**Eugene Burmako**

Macro paradise is an alias of the experimental `paradise/macros` branch in the official Scala repository, designed to facilitate rapid development of macros without compromising the stability of Scala. To learn more about this branch, check out [my talk](http://scalamacros.org/news/2012/12/18/macro-paradise.html).

By the beginning of January 2013 we will set up a nightly build that will publish snapshot artifacts to Sonatype. For now you can download a build of macro paradise from [https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10497693/pack.zip](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10497693/pack.zip). Consult [https://github.com/scalamacros/sbt-example-paradise](https://github.com/scalamacros/sbt-example-paradise) for instructions on how to integrate this custom Scala build into SBT.
