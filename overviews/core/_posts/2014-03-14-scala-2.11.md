## What's new in Scala 2.11
TODO: we'll have a migration guide here before 2.11 goes final.
In the mean time, see the RC1 release notes: http://www.scala-lang.org/news/2014/03/06/release-notes-2.11.0-RC1.html

### Modularization
<!-- The compiler links to this heading as http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/scala-2.11.html#scala-xml -->
#### scala-xml
The package scala.xml has been moved out of scala-library.jar.
To compile code that contains XML literals, add a dependency on scala-xml or your preferred alternative.
