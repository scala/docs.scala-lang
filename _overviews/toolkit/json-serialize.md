## Serializing a Map to JSON

uPickle can serialize your Scala objects to JSON, so that you can save them in files or send them over the network.

By default it can serialize primitive types such as `Int` or `String`, as well as standard collections such as `Map` and `List`.

{% tabs 'array' %}
{% tab 'Scala 2 and 3' %}
```scala mdoc
val map: Map[String, Int] =
  Map("Toolkitty" -> 3, "Scaniel" -> 5)
val jsonString: String = upickle.default.write(map)
println(jsonString)
// prints: {"Toolkitty":3,"Scaniel":5}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Serializing a custom object to JSON

In Scala, you can use a `case class` to define your own data type.
For example, to represent a pet owner with the name of its pets, you can
```scala mdoc:reset
case class PetOwner(name: String, pets: List[String])
```

To be able to write a `PetOwner` to JSON we need to provide a `ReadWriter` instance for the case class `PetOwner`.
Luckily, `upickle` is able to fully automate that:

{% tabs 'given' class=tabs-scala-version %}
{% tab 'Scala 2' %}
```scala mdoc
import upickle.default._

implicit val ownerRw: ReadWriter[PetOwner] = macroRW[PetOwner]
```
Some explanations:
- An `implicit val` is a value that can be automatically provided as an argument to a method or function call, without having to explicitly pass it.
- `macroRW` is a method provided by uPickle that can generate a instances of `ReadWriter` for case classes, using the information about its fields.
{% endtab %}
{% tab 'Scala 3' %}
```scala
import upickle.default.*

case class PetOwner(name: String, pets: List[String]) derives ReadWriter
```
The `derives` keyword is used to automatically generate given instances.
Using the compiler's knowledge of the fields in `PetOwner`, it generates a `ReadWriter[PetOwner]`.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

This means that you can now write (and read) `PetOwner` objects to JSON with `upickle.default.write(petOwner)`.

Notice that you do not need to pass the instance of `ReadWriter[PetOwner]` explicitly to the `write` method. But it does, nevertheless, get it from the context, as "given" value. You may find more information about contextual abstractions in the [Scala 3 Book](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/ca-contextual-abstractions-intro.html).

Putting everything together you should get:

{% tabs 'full' class=tabs-scala-version %}
{% tab 'Scala 2' %}
```scala
import upickle.default._

case class PetOwner(name: String, pets: List[String])
implicit val ownerRw: ReadWriter[PetOwner] = macroRW

val petOwner = PetOwner("Peter", List("Toolkitty", "Scaniel"))
val json: String = write(petOwner)
println(json)
// prints: {"name":"Peter","pets":["Toolkitty","Scaniel"]}"
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab 'Scala 3' %}
```scala
import upickle.default._

case class PetOwner(name: String, pets: List[String]) derives ReadWriter

val petOwner = PetOwner("Peter", List("Toolkitty", "Scaniel"))
val json: String = write(petOwner)
println(json)
// prints: {"name":"Peter","pets":["Toolkitty","Scaniel"]}"
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
