## What is OS-Lib?

OS-Lib is a library for manipulating files and processes. It is part of the Scala Toolkit.

OS-Lib aims to replace the `java.nio.file` and `java.lang.ProcessBuilder` APIs. You should not need to use any underlying Java APIs directly.

OS-lib also aims to supplant the older `scala.io` and `scala.sys` APIs in the Scala standard library.

OS-Lib has no dependencies.

All of OS-Lib is in the `os.*` namespace.

## Learning more

The Scala Toolkit site provides short tutorials for using OS-Lib for a handful of common tasks. For more complete information on the library, see [OS-Lib on GitHub](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/os-lib).
