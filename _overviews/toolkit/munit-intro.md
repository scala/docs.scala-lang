MUnit is a lightweight testing library that focuses on ease of use and flexibility. It provides a single test syntax that help you get started quiclky, even if you are new to testing with Scala.

Despite its simplicity, MUnit contains all the most useful features for testing:
- assertions to verify the behavior of the program
- fixtures to ensure that the tests have access to all the necessary resources
- asynchronous support, for testing concurrent and distributed applications.

MUnit produces actionable error reports, with diifs and source location, to help you quickly understand a test failure.
