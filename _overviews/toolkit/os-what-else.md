[OS-Lib on GitHub](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/os-lib) has many additional examples of how to perform common tasks:
- creating, moving, copying, removing files and folders,
- reading filesystem metadata and permissions,
- spawning subprocesses,
- watching changes in folders,
- interoperating with `java.io.File` and `java.nio.Path`.
