MUnit is a lightweight testing library. It provides a single style for writing tests, a style that can be learned quickly.

Despite its simplicity, MUnit has useful features such as:
- assertions to verify the behavior of the program
- fixtures to ensure that the tests have access to all the necessary resources
- asynchronous support, for testing concurrent and distributed applications.

MUnit produces actionable error reports, with diff and source location, to help you quickly understand failures.

Testing is essential for any software development process because it helps catch bugs early, improves code quality and facilitates collaboration.
