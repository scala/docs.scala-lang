## What is the Scala Toolkit?

The Scala Toolkit is a set of libraries designed to make common programming tasks simpler and more efficient.
Whether you're working on a script or an application, the toolkit provides a wide range of tools to help you get the job done.

These tutorials show you how to use the libraries in the Toolkit to
do ordinary programming tasks such as working with files, processes,
HTTP requests, JSON, and unit tests.

The Scala toolkit adapts to your environment: it is available in Scala 2 and Scala 3 and it is cross-platform.
Using the Toolkit you can run on the JVM, you can compile to JavaScript to run in the browser, or you can package native binaries that start up immediately.

Overall, the Scala Toolkit is an essential resource for any developer looking to simplify their coding tasks.
In this series of tutorials, you'll find many short code examples, to help you get started quickly and be more productive with Scala.

## How to run the code?

You can follow the tutorials regardless of how you choose to run your
Scala code. The tutorials focus on the code itself, rather than on
the process of running it.

Ways to run Scala code include:

* in your web browser with Scastie
* interactively in the Scala REPL (Read/Eval/Print Loop)
* interactively in a worksheet in your IDE
* in scripts, using Scala CLI
* using a build tool (such as sbt or mill)
* using an IDE (such as IntelliJ or Metals)
