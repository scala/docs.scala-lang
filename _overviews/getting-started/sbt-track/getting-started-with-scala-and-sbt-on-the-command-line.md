In this tutorial, you'll see how to create a Scala project from
a template. You can use this as a starting point for your own
projects. We'll use [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/index.html), the de facto build tool for Scala. sbt compiles,
runs, and tests your projects among other related tasks.
We assume you know how to use a terminal.

## Installation
1. Make sure you have the Java 8 JDK (also known as 1.8)
    * Run `javac -version` in the command line and make sure you see
    `javac 1.8.___`
    * If you don't have version 1.8 or higher, [install the JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
1. Install sbt
    * [Mac](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Mac.html)
    * [Windows](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Windows.html)
    * [Linux](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Linux.html)

## Create the project

{% tabs sbt-welcome-1 class=tabs-scala-version %}
{% tab 'Scala 2' for=sbt-welcome-1 %}

1. `cd` to an empty folder.
1. Run the following command `sbt new scala/hello-world.g8`.
This pulls the 'hello-world' template from GitHub.
It will also create a `target` folder, which you can ignore.
1. When prompted, name the application `hello-world`. This will
create a project called "hello-world".
1. Let's take a look at what just got generated:

{% endtab %}
{% tab 'Scala 3' for=sbt-welcome-1 %}

1. `cd` to an empty folder.
1. Run the following command `sbt new scala/scala3.g8`.
This pulls the 'scala3' template from GitHub.
It will also create a `target` folder, which you can ignore.
1. When prompted, name the application `hello-world`. This will
create a project called "hello-world".
1. Let's take a look at what just got generated:

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}


```
- hello-world
    - project (sbt uses this to install and manage plugins and dependencies)
        - build.properties
    - src
        - main
            - scala (All of your scala code goes here)
                - Main.scala (Entry point of program) <-- this is all we need for now
    - build.sbt (sbt's build definition file)
```

After you build your project, sbt will create more `target` directories
for generated files. You can ignore these.

## Running the project
1. `cd` into `hello-world`.
1. Run `sbt`. This will open up the sbt console.
1. Type `~run`. The `~` is optional and causes sbt to re-run on every file save,
allowing for a fast edit/run/debug cycle. sbt will also generate a `target` directory
which you can ignore.

## Modifying the code
1. Open the file `src/main/scala/Main.scala` in your favorite text editor.
1. Change "Hello, World!" to "Hello, New York!"
1. If you haven't stopped the sbt command, you should see "Hello, New York!"
printed to the console.
1. You can continue to make changes and see the results in the console.

## Adding a dependency
Changing gears a bit, let's look at how to use published libraries to add
extra functionality to our apps.

1. Open up `build.sbt` and add the following line:

```
libraryDependencies += "org.scala-lang.modules" %% "scala-parser-combinators" % "2.1.1"
```
Here, `libraryDependencies` is a set of dependencies, and by using `+=`,
we're adding the [scala-parser-combinators](https://github.com/scala/scala-parser-combinators) dependency to the set of dependencies that sbt will go
and fetch when it starts up. Now, in any Scala file, you can import classes,
objects, etc, from `scala-parser-combinators` with a regular import.

You can find more published libraries on
[Scaladex](https://index.scala-lang.org/), the Scala library index, where you
can also copy the above dependency information for pasting into your `build.sbt`
file.

> **Note for Java Libraries:** For a regular Java library, you should only use one percent (`%`) between the
> organization name and artifact name. Double percent (`%%`) is a specialisation for Scala libraries.
> You can learn more about the reason for this in the [sbt documentation][sbt-docs-lib-dependencies].
