There are multiple libraries and testing methodologies for Scala,
but in this tutorial, we'll demonstrate one popular option from the ScalaTest framework
called [FunSuite](https://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_fun_suite).

This assumes you know [how to build a project in IntelliJ](building-a-scala-project-with-intellij-and-sbt.html).

## Setup
1. Create an sbt project in IntelliJ.
1. Add the ScalaTest dependency:
    1. Add the ScalaTest dependency to your `build.sbt` file:
        ```
        libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "3.2.11" % Test
        ```
    1. If you get a notification "build.sbt was changed", select **auto-import**.
    1. These two actions will cause `sbt` to download the ScalaTest library.
    1. Wait for the `sbt` sync to finish; otherwise, `AnyFunSuite` and `test()` will be
        unrecognized.
1. On the project pane on the left, expand `src` => `main`.
1. Right-click on `scala` and select **New** => **Scala class**.
1. Call it `CubeCalculator`, change the **Kind** to `object`, and hit enter or double-click on `object`.
1. Replace the code with the following:
    ```
    object CubeCalculator:
      def cube(x: Int) =
        x * x * x
    ```

## Creating a test
1. On the project pane on the left, expand `src` => `test`.
1. Right-click on `scala` and select **New** => **Scala class**.
1. Name the class `CubeCalculatorTest` and hit enter or double-click on `class`.
1. Replace the code with the following:
    ```
    import org.scalatest.funsuite.AnyFunSuite
    
    class CubeCalculatorTest extends AnyFunSuite:
      test("CubeCalculator.cube") {
        assert(CubeCalculator.cube(3) === 27)
      }
    ```
1. In the source code, right-click `CubeCalculatorTest` and select
    **Run 'CubeCalculatorTest'**.

## Understanding the code

Let's go over this line by line:

* `class CubeCalculatorTest` means we are testing the object `CubeCalculator`
* `extends AnyFunSuite` lets us use functionality of ScalaTest's AnyFunSuite class
such as the `test` function
* `test` is a function that comes from the FunSuite library that collects
results from assertions within the function body.
* `"CubeCalculator.cube"` is a name for the test. You can call it anything but
one convention is "ClassName.methodName".
* `assert` takes a boolean condition and determines whether the test passes or fails.
* `CubeCalculator.cube(3) === 27` checks whether the output of the `cube` function is
indeed 27. The `===` is part of ScalaTest and provides clean error messages.

## Adding another test case
1. Add another `assert` statement after the first one that checks for the cube
    of `0`.
1. Re-run the test again by right-clicking `CubeCalculatorTest` and selecting
    'Run **CubeCalculatorTest**'.

## Conclusion
You've seen one way to test your Scala code. You can learn more about ScalaTest's
FunSuite on the [official website](https://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_fun_suite).
