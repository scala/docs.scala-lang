Operations in [scala.compiletime][compiletime-api] are metaprogramming operations that can be used within an `inline` method.
These operation do cover some common use cases of macros without you needing to define a macro.

## Reporting

It is possible to emit error messages when inlining code.

```scala
inline def doSomething(inline mode: Boolean): Unit =
  if mode then ...
  else if !mode then ...
  else error("Mode must be a known value")

doSomething(true)
doSomething(false)
val bool: Boolean = ...
doSomething(bool) // error: Mode must be a known value
```

If `error` is called outside an inline method, the error will be emitted when compiling that call.
If the `error` is written inside an inline method, the error will be emitted only if, after inlining the call, it is not removed as part of a dead branch.
In the previous example, if the value of `mode` were known at compile time, we would only keep one of the first two branches.

If we want to include part of the source code of the arguments in the error message, we can use the `codeOf` method.

```scala
inline def doSomething(inline mode: Boolean): Unit =
  if mode then ...
  else if !mode then ...
  else error("Mode must be a known value but got: " + codeOf(mode))

val bool: Boolean = ...
doSomething(bool) // error: Mode must be a known value but got: bool
```

## Summoning

There are two ways to summon values in inline methods, the first is with a `using` parameter and the second is with one of `summonInline`, `summonAll` or `summonFrom`.
`using` will summon the value at call site before inlining as if the method was not `inline`.
On the other hand, `summonInline` will summon after inlining if the call is not eliminated from a dead branch.
`summonAll` provides a way to summon multiple values at the same time from a tuple type.
`summonFrom` provides a way to try several implicit searches.
