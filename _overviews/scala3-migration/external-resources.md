## Courses

### Lunatech's [_Moving from Scala 2 to Scala 3_](https://github.com/lunatech-labs/lunatech-scala-2-to-scala3-course)

If you're a Scala 2 application developer who's looking at getting up-to-speed on Scala 3 or who's considering a migration of an existing Scala 2 application to Scala 3, Lunatech's [_"Moving from Scala 2 to Scala 3"_](https://github.com/lunatech-labs/lunatech-scala-2-to-scala3-course) course is a good way to get started.

This course guides you through a migration of a single-module Akka Typed Sudoku solver in a series of about 10 steps. It covers the practical application of the following Scala 3 features:

- New Control Structure syntax
- Indentation Based syntax
- Syntax rewriting by the Scala 3 compiler
- Top Level definitions
- Parameter untupling
- Contextual Abstractions:
  - Extension methods new syntax
  - Given instances and Using clauses
- Enumerations and Export clauses
- Intersection and Union Types
- Opaque Type Aliases
- Multiversal Equality
