You are ready to port your project to Scala 3!

The first step is to check that the [Prerequisites](tutorial-prerequisites.html) are met by your project.
Then you can go to the [Porting a sbt Project](tutorial-sbt.html) tutorial to learn about the migration workflow.

> **You are not using sbt?**
> 
> We still advise you to read the [Porting a sbt Project](tutorial-sbt.html) tutorial since the workflow should be very similar. 
> Prior to that, make sure the version of your build tool is up-to-date to support Scala 3.


[Cross-Building a Macro Library](tutorial-macro-cross-building.html) and [Mixing Scala 2.13 and Scala 3 Macros](tutorial-macro-mixing.html) are specialized tutorials for porting Scala 2 macro libraries.
