You are ready to port your project to Scala 3!

The first step is to check that the [Prerequisites](tutorial-prerequisites.html) are met by your project.

If you use sbt we recommend you to go to [Porting an sbt Project (using sbt-scala3-migrate)](scala3-migrate.html), or you can go to [Porting an sbt Project (by hand)](tutorial-sbt.html).

> **You are not using sbt?**
> 
> We still advise you to read the [Porting a sbt Project (by hand)](tutorial-sbt.html) tutorial since the workflow is the same in other build tools. 
> Prior to that, make sure the version of your build tool is up-to-date to support Scala 3.


[Cross-Building a Macro Library](tutorial-macro-cross-building.html) and [Mixing Scala 2.13 and Scala 3 Macros](tutorial-macro-mixing.html) are specialized tutorials for porting Scala 2 macro libraries.
