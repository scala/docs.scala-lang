| Scala2 | Scala3 | Description | Comment | Is implemented?
| ------------- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| -doc-format | _ | Selects in which format documentation is rendered. | Actually, old scaladoc supports only html, so it is in some way consistent with new scaladoc, which provides only html | <i class="fa fa-times fa-lg"></i> |  
| -doc-title | -project | The overall name of the Scaladoc site | Aliased in [#11965](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/11965) | <i class="fa fa-check fa-lg"></i> | 
| -doc-version | -project-version | | Aliased in [#11965](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/11965)  | <i class="fa fa-check fa-lg"></i> | 
| -doc-footer | -project-footer | A footer on every Scaladoc page, by default the EPFL/Lightbend copyright notice. Can be overridden with a custom footer. | Fixed by [#11965](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/11965) | <i class="fa fa-check fa-lg"></i> |  
| -doc-no-compile | _ | A directory containing sources which should be parsed for docstrings without compiling (e.g. AnyRef.scala) | We don't need this as we have completely different approach to that issue using -Ydocument-synthetic-types flag for synthetic types | <i class="fa fa-check fa-lg"></i> | 
| -doc-source-url | -source-links | A URL pattern used to link to the source file, with some variables supported... | Scala3 implementation provides richer syntax. You can find migration steps below this [table](#source-links). | <i class="fa fa-check fa-lg"></i> |
| -doc-external-doc | -external-mappings | Links describing locations of external dependencies' documentations. | Scala3 implementation provides richer syntax. You can find migration steps below this [table](#external-mappings). | <i class="fa fa-check fa-lg"></i> |
| -jdk-api-doc-base | -external-mappings | URL used to link Java API references. | You can specify jdk via -external-mappings since they are generalized setting. You can find migration steps below this [table](#external-mappings) | <i class="fa fa-check fa-lg"></i> |

## Source links

Source links are used to point to source code at some remote repository like github or bitbucket.
Hopefully, the new syntax is almost superset of the old syntax. 
To migrate to the new scaladoc syntax, make sure that you don't use any of these variables:
`€{TPL_OWNER}` or `€{FILE_PATH_EXT}`. Otherwise you have to rewrite your source link, using either other `variables` or you can use new
syntax, about which you can read more at [dotty docs](https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/usage/scaladoc/settings.html) 
Note that new syntax let you specify prefixes of your files paths to match specific url in case your sources are scattered in different
directories or even different repositories.


## External mappings

This setting is a generalized form of the old settings for javadoc/scaladoc.

Example external mapping is:
```
-external-mappings:.*scala.*::scaladoc3::https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/,.*java.*::javadoc::https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/
```

A mapping is of the form '\<regex>::\[scaladoc3|scaladoc|javadoc]::\<path>'. You can supply several mappings, separated by commas, as shown in the example.

Given that the old syntaxes were:
- for scaladoc - `prefix#url`
- for javadoc - just URL

one must take the regex that will match fq name (for javadoc, it can be wildcard like `java.*`), then concatenate it using double colons `::`
with one of the 3 available documentation formats, then again append `::` and then provide url for where the extednal documentation is hosted.
