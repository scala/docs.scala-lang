I hope you enjoyed this introduction to [the Scala programming language](https://www.scala-lang.org), and I hope I was able to share some of the beauty of the language.

If you’re ready to get started working with Scala, you can begin by downloading it here:

- [scala-lang.org/download](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/)

<!--
To learn more about Scala, here are some of the best resources I know. First, as a special mention, [Programming in Scala](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Scala-Updated-2-12/dp/0981531687/) is written by Martin Odersky (creator of Scala), Bill Venners (creator of ScalaTest and more), and Lex Spoon, and I consider it to be *the* reference for the Scala language.

My other books on Scala are:

- *Scala Cookbook*
- *Functional Programming, Simplified*

The Cookbook shares the most common recipes for working with Scala, and the second book attempts to make learning functional programming as simple as possible.

In alphabetical order, I’ve read these other books, and I can recommend them:

- *Akka Concurrency*
- *Functional and Reactive Domain Modeling*
- *Functional Programming in Scala*
- *Java Concurrency in Practice*
- *Learning Concurrent Programming in Scala*
- *Scala for the Impatient* is a good quick reference guide
