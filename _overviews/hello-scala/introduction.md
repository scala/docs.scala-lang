*Hello, Scala* provides a quick introduction and overview of the [Scala programming language](http://scala-lang.org). The book is written in an informal style, and consists of about 55 small lessons. Each lesson is long enough to give you an idea of how the language features in that lesson work, but short enough that you can read it in fifteen minutes or less.

Two notes before beginning:

- This book was originally written by Alvin Alexander, so when you see “I” or “my” in the text, that’s who is being referred to. (That wording will eventually be updated.)
- In regards to programming style, most Scala programmers indent their code with two spaces, but I use four spaces because I think it makes the code easier to read, especially in a book format.

To begin reading, just select the *A Taste of Scala* lesson in the table of contents.
