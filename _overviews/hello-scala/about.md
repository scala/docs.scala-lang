Here are a few notes to wrap up the book:

*Hello, Scala* was originally created by [Alvin Alexander](https://alvinalexander.com), author of the *Scala Cookbook* and *Functional Programming, Simplified*. Over time this document will be updated by the Scala community.

If you prefer reading printed books, you can [buy “Hello, Scala” on Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Hello-Scala-Alvin-Alexander/dp/1720790027/).

And finally a bit of gratitude on my behalf: Many thanks to the creators of [the Scala programming language](https://www.scala-lang.org) for creating such a wonderful language.
