Scala lets you write code in an object-oriented programming (OOP) style, a functional programming (FP) style, and even in a hybrid style, using both approaches in combination. I assume that you’re coming to Scala from an OOP language like Java, C++, or C#, so outside of covering Scala classes I haven’t written any special sections about OOP in this book. But because the FP style is still relatively new to many developers, I will provide a brief introduction to Scala’s support for FP in the next several lessons.

*Functional programming* is a style of programming that emphasizes writing applications using only pure functions and immutable values. As I wrote in [Functional Programming, Simplified](https://alvinalexander.com/scala/learning-functional-programming-in-scala-book), rather than using that description, it’s more accurate to say that functional programmers have a strong desire to see their code as algebra — to see the combination of their functions as a series of algebraic equations. In that regard, you could say that functional programmers like to think of themselves as mathematicians. That’s the driving desire that leads them to use *only* pure functions and immutable values, because that’s what you use in algebra and other forms of math.

*Functional Programming, Simplified* is a large book, and there’s no way I can condense all of that FP knowledge into this little book, but what I can do is give you a little taste of functional programming, and show some of the tools Scala provides for developers to write functional code.
