In the next few lessons I’ll introduce a couple of tools that are commonly used in Scala projects:

- The [SBT build tool](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)
- [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/), a code testing framework

I’ll begin by showing how to use SBT, and then I’ll show how to use ScalaTest and SBT together.
