If you’re ready to tackle a slightly larger Scala application, I wrote a little “Notes” application using Scala and JavaFX to accompany this tutorial. If you’d like to see how it works, here’s a two-minute video introduction:

<div><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vI1l97ETxw" width="480"></iframe></div>

If you want to dig into it, the source code for the project is at this Github URL:

- [github.com/alvinj/NotesWithScalaJavaFX](https://github.com/alvinj/NotesWithScalaJavaFX)

I won’t describe the application here because a) the video is the best way to show how it works, and b) I include a lengthy README file with the source code. So, please see that project for more information.
