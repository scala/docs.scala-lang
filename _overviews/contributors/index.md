title: Library Author Guide
---
This document targets developers who want to publish their work as a library that other programs can depend on.
The document steps through the main questions that should be answered before publishing an open source library,
and shows how a typical development environment looks like.

An example of library that follows the recommendations given here is available at
[https://github.com/scalacenter/library-example](https://github.com/scalacenter/library-example). For the sake
of conciseness, this example uses commonly chosen technologies like GitHub, Travis CI, and sbt, but alternative
technologies will be mentioned and adapting the contents of this document for them should be straightforward.

## Choose an Open Source License

The first step consists in choosing an open source license specifying under which conditions the library
can be reused by other people. You can browse the already existing open source licenses on the
[opensource.org](https://opensource.org/licenses) website. If you don’t know which one to pick, we suggest
using the [Apache License 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0), which allows users to use (including
commercial use), share, modify and redistribute (including under different terms) your work under the condition
that the license and copyright notices are preserved. For the record, Scala itself is licensed with Apache 2.0.

Once you have chosen a license, *apply* it to your project by creating a `LICENSE` file in the root directory
of your project with the license contents or a link to it. This file usually indicates who owns the copyright.
In our example of [LICENSE file](https://github.com/scalacenter/library-example/blob/main/LICENSE), we have
written that all the contributors (as per the Git log) own the copyright.

## Host the Source Code

We recommend sharing the source code of your library by hosting it on a public [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
hosting site such as [GitHub](https://github.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).
In our example, we use GitHub.

Your project should include a [README](https://github.com/scalacenter/library-example/blob/main/README.md) file
including a description of what the library does and some documentation (or links to the documentation).

You should take care of putting only source files under version control. For instance, artifacts generated by the
build system should *not* be versioned. You can instruct Git to ignore such files by adding them to a
[.gitignore](https://github.com/scalacenter/library-example/blob/main/.gitignore) file.

In case you are using sbt, make sure your repository has a
[project/build.properties](https://github.com/scalacenter/library-example/blob/main/project/build.properties)
file indicating the sbt version to use, so that people (or tools) working on your repository will automatically
use the correct sbt version.

## Setup Continuous Integration

The first reason for setting up a continuous integration (CI) server is to systematically run tests on pull requests.
Examples of CI servers that are free for open source projects are [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions),
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com), [Drone](https://drone.io) or [AppVeyor](https://appveyor.com).

Our example uses Github Actions. This feature is enabled by default on GitHub repositories. You can verify if that is
the case in the *Actions* section of the *Settings* tab of the repository.
If *Disable all actions* is checked, then Actions are not enabled and you can activate them
by selecting *Allow all actions*, *Allow local actions only* or *Allow select actions*.

With Actions enabled, you can create a *workflow definition file*. A **workflow** is an automated procedure,
composed of one or more jobs. A **job** is a set of sequential steps that are executed on the same runner.
A **step** is an individual task that can run commands; a step can be either an *action* or a shell command.
An **action** is the smallest building block of a workflow, it is possible to reuse community actions or to
define new ones.

To create a workflow, create a *yaml* file in the directory `.github/workflows/` in the repository, for example
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` with the following content:

~~~ yaml
name: Continuous integration
on: push

jobs:
  ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3 # Retrieve the content of the repository
      - uses: actions/setup-java@v3 # Set up a jdk
        with:
          distribution: temurin
          java-version: 8
          cache: sbt # Cache the artifacts downloaded by sbt accross CI runs
      - name: unit tests # Custom action consisting of a shell command
        run: sbt +test
~~~

This workflow is called *Continuous integration* and it will run every time one
or more commits are pushed to the repository. It contains only one job called
*ci*, which will run on an Ubuntu runner and that is composed of three
actions. The action `setup-java` installs a JDK and caches the library dependencies
downloaded by sbt so that they are not downloaded again everytime the CI runs.

Then, the job runs `sbt +test`, which loads the sbt version specified in
`project/build.properties`, and runs the project tests using the Scala version
defined in the file `build.sbt`.

The workflow above will run at any push to any branch of the repository. You
can specify the branch or add more triggers such as pull requests, releases,
tags or schedules. More information about workflow triggers is available
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows).
while the `setup-java` action is hosted [in this
repository](https://github.com/actions/setup-java).

For reference, here is our complete [workflow example
file](https://github.com/scalacenter/library-example/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Publish a Release

Most build tools resolve third-party dependencies by looking them up on public repositories such as
[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/). These repositories host
the library binaries as well as additional information such as the library authors, the open source
license, and the dependencies of the library itself. Each release of a library is identified by
a `groupId`, an `artifactId`, and a `version` number. For instance, consider the following dependency
(written in sbt’s syntax):

~~~ scala
"org.slf4j" % "slf4j-simple" % "1.7.25"
~~~

Its `groupId` is `org.slf4j`, its `artifactId` is `slf4j-simple`, and its `version` is `1.7.25`.

In this document, we show how to publish the Maven Central repository.
This process requires having a [Sonatype](https://central.sonatype.org/) account and a PGP key pair to
sign the binaries.

### Create a Sonatype Account and Project

Follow the instructions given on the [OSSRH Guide](https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html#initial-setup)
to create a new Sonatype account (unless you already have one) and to
[create a new project ticket](https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?issuetype=21&pid=10134). This latter
step is where you define the `groupId` that you will release to. You can use a domain name that you already own,
otherwise a common practice is to use `io.github.(username)` (where `(username)` is replaced with your GitHub
username).

This step has to be performed only once per `groupId` you want to have.

### Create a PGP Key Pair

Sonatype [requires](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements) that you sign the published files
with PGP. Follow the instructions [here](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/gpg)
to generate a key pair and to distribute your public key to a key server.

This step has to be performed only once per person.

### Setup Your Project

In case you use sbt, we recommend using the [sbt-sonatype](https://github.com/xerial/sbt-sonatype)
and [sbt-pgp](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-pgp/) plugins to publish your artifacts. Add the following
dependencies to your `project/plugins.sbt` file:

~~~ scala
addSbtPlugin("org.xerial.sbt" % "sbt-sonatype" % "3.9.7")
addSbtPlugin("com.jsuereth" % "sbt-pgp" % "2.1.1")
~~~

And make sure your build fulfills the [Sonatype requirements](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements)
by defining the following settings:

~~~ scala
// used as `artifactId`
name := "library-example"

// used as `groupId`
organization := "ch.epfl.scala"

// open source licenses that apply to the project
licenses := Seq("APL2" -> url("https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt"))

description := "A library that does nothing useful"

import xerial.sbt.Sonatype._
sonatypeProjectHosting := Some(GitHubHosting("scalacenter", "library-example", "julien.richard-foy@epfl.ch"))

// publish to the sonatype repository
publishTo := sonatypePublishToBundle.value
~~~

Put your Sonatype credentials in a `$HOME/.sbt/1.0/sonatype.sbt` file:

~~~ scala
credentials += Credentials("Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager",
        "oss.sonatype.org",
        "(Sonatype user name)",
        "(Sonatype password)")
~~~

(Put your actual user name and password in place of `(Sonatype user name)` and `(Sonatype password)`)

**Never** check this file into version control.

Last, we recommend using the [sbt-dynver](https://github.com/dwijnand/sbt-dynver) plugin to set the version number
of your releases. Add the following dependency to your `project/plugins.sbt` file:

~~~ scala
addSbtPlugin("com.dwijnand" % "sbt-dynver" % "4.1.1")
~~~

And make sure your build does **not** define the `version` setting.

### Cut a Release

With this setup, the process for cutting a release is the following.

Create a Git tag whose name begins with a lowercase `v` followed by the version number:

~~~ bash
$ git tag v0.1.0
~~~

This tag is used by `sbt-dynver` to compute the version of the release (`0.1.0`, in this example).

Deploy your artifact to the Central repository with the `publishSigned` sbt task:

~~~ bash
$ sbt publishSigned
~~~

`sbt-sonatype` will package your project and ask your PGP passphrase to sign the files with your PGP key.
It will then upload the files to Sonatype using your account credentials. When the task is finished, you can
check the artifacts in the [Nexus Repository Manager](https://oss.sonatype.org) (under “Staging Repositories” in the side menu − if you do not see it, make sure you are logged in).

Finally, perform the release with the `sonatypeRelease` sbt task:

~~~ bash
$ sbt sonatypeRelease
~~~

## Setup Continuous Publication

The release process described above has some drawbacks:
- it requires running three commands,
- it does not guarantee that the library is in a stable state when it is published (ie, some tests may be failing),
- in case you work in a team, each contributor has to setup its own PGP key pair and have to have Sonatype
  credentials with access to the project’s `groupId`.

Continuous publication addresses these issues by delegating the publication process to the CI server. It works as
follows: any contributor with write access to the repository can cut a release by pushing a Git tag, the CI server
first checks that the tests pass and then runs the publication commands.

The remaining sections show how to setup GitHub Actions for continuous publication on Sonatype. You can find instructions
for Travis CI in the [sbt-ci-release](https://github.com/olafurpg/sbt-ci-release) plugin documentation.

### Setup the CI Server

You have to give your Sonatype account credentials to the CI server, as well as your PGP key pair. Fortunately,
it is possible to securely give this information by using the secret management system of the CI server.

#### Export Your Sonatype Account Credentials

Create two [GitHub Encrypted secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets)
for your Sonatype account credentials: `SONATYPE_USERNAME` and `SONATYPE_PASSWORD`.
To do so, go to the *Settings* tab of the repository and select *Secrets* on the left panel.
You can then use the button *New repository secret* to open the secret creation menu where you will enter
the name of the secret and its content.

Repository Secrets allow us to safely store confidential information and to expose
it to Actions workflows without the risk of committing them to git history.

#### Export Your PGP Key Pair

To export your PGP key pair, you first need to know its identifier. Use the following command to list
your PGP keys:

~~~ bash
$ gpg --list-secret-keys
/home/julien/.gnupg/secring.gpg
-------------------------------
sec   2048R/BE614499 2016-08-12
uid                  Julien Richard-Foy <julien.richard-foy@epfl.ch>
~~~

In my case, I have one key pair, whose ID is `BE614499`.


Then:

 1. Create a new Secret containing the passphrase of your PGP key named `PGP_PASSPHRASE`.
 2. Create a new Secret containing the base64 encoded secret of your private key named `PGP_SECRET`. The encoded secret can obtain by running:
```
# macOS
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys $LONG_ID | base64
# Ubuntu (assuming GNU base64)
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys $LONG_ID | base64 -w0
# Arch
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys $LONG_ID | base64 | sed -z 's;\n;;g'
# FreeBSD (assuming BSD base64)
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys $LONG_ID | base64
# Windows
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys %LONG_ID% | openssl base64
```
 3. Publish your public key signature to a public server, for example [http://keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371](http://keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371/).
 You can obtain the signature by running:
```
# macOS and linux
gpg --armor --export $LONG_ID
# Windows
gpg --armor --export %LONG_ID%
```
(Replace `(key ID)` with **your** key ID)


#### Publish From the CI Server

On GitHub Actions, you can define a workflow to publish the library when a tag is pushed:

~~~ yaml
# .github/workflows/publish.yml
name: Continuous publication
on:
  push:
    branches: ['**']
    tags: [v*]

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # fetch all tags, required to compute the release version
      - uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          distribution: temurin
          java-version: 8
          cache: sbt
      - run: sbt ci-release
        env:
          PGP_PASSPHRASE: ${{ secrets.PGP_PASSPHRASE }}
          PGP_SECRET: ${{ secrets.PGP_SECRET }}
          SONATYPE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_PASSWORD }}
          SONATYPE_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.SONATYPE_USERNAME }}
~~~

The `env` statement exposes the secrets you defined earlier to the publication process through
environment variables.

### Cut a Release

Just push a Git tag:

~~~ bash
$ git tag v0.2.0
$ git push origin v0.2.0
~~~

## Cross-Publish

If you have written a library, you probably want it to be usable from several Scala major versions (e.g., 2.11.x,
2.12.x, 2.13.x, etc.).

Define the versions you want to support in the `crossScalaVersions` setting, in your `build.sbt` file:

~~~ scala
crossScalaVersions := Seq("2.13.6", "2.12.14")
scalaVersion := crossScalaVersions.value.head
~~~

The second line makes sbt use by default the first Scala version of the `crossScalaVersions`.
The CI job will use all the Scala versions of your build definition.

## Publish Online Documentation

An important property of documentation is that the code examples should compile and behave as they
are presented. There are various ways to ensure that this property holds. One way, supported by
[mdoc](https://github.com/scalameta/mdoc), is to actually
evaluate code examples and write the result of their evaluation in the produced documentation.
Another way consists in embedding snippets of source code coming from a real module or example.

The [sbt-site](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-site) plugin can help you organize, build and preview your
documentation. It is well integrated with other sbt plugins for generating the documentation content
or for publishing the resulting documentation to a web server.

Finally, a simple solution for publishing the documentation online consists in using the
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) service, which is automatically available for each GitHub
repository. The [sbt-ghpages](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-ghpages) plugin can automatically upload
an sbt-site to GitHub Pages.

### Create the Documentation Site

In this example we choose to use [Paradox](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/paradox/current/index.html)
because it runs on the JVM and thus doesn’t require setting up another VM on your system (in contrast with
most other documentation generators, which are based on Ruby, Node.js or Python).

To install Paradox and sbt-site, add the following lines to your `project/plugins.sbt` file:

~~~ scala
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-site" % "1.4.1")
addSbtPlugin("com.lightbend.paradox" % "sbt-paradox" % "0.9.2")
~~~

And then add the following configuration to your `build.sbt` file:

{% highlight scala %}
enablePlugins(ParadoxPlugin, ParadoxSitePlugin)
Paradox / sourceDirectory := sourceDirectory.value / "documentation"
{% endhighlight %}

The `ParadoxPlugin` is responsible of generating the website, and the `ParadoxSitePlugin` provides
integration with `sbt-site`.
The second line is optional, it defines the location of the website source files. In our case, in
`src/documentation`.

Add your documentation entry point in an `src/documentation/index.md` file. A typical documentation entry point
uses the library name as title, shows a short sentence describing the purpose of the library, and a code
snippet for adding the library to a build definition:

{% highlight markdown %}
# Library Example

A library that does nothing.

## Setup

Add the following dependency to your `build.sbt` file:

@@@vars
~~~ scala
libraryDependencies += "ch.epfl.scala" %% "library-example" % "$project.version$"
~~~
@@@

@@@ index
* [Getting Started](getting-started.md)
* [Reference](reference.md)
@@@
{% endhighlight %}

Note that in our case we rely on a variable substitution mechanism to inject the correct version number
in the documentation so that we don’t have to always update that part of the docs each time we publish a
new release.

Our example also includes an `@@@index` directive, defining how the content of the documentation is organized.
In our case, the documentation contains two pages, the first one provides a quick tutorial for getting
familiar with the library, and the second one provides more detailed information.

The sbt-site plugin provides a convenient `previewAuto` task that serves the resulting documentation locally,
so that you can see how it looks like, and re-generate the documentation when you edit it:

~~~
sbt:library-example> previewAuto
Embedded server listening at
  https://127.0.0.1:4000
Press any key to stop.
~~~

Browse the [https://localhost:4000](https://localhost:4000) URL to see the result:

![](/resources/images/documentation-preview.png)

### Include Code Examples

This section shows two ways to make sure that code examples included in the documentation do compile
and behave as they are presented.

#### Using a Markdown Preprocessor

One approach consists in using a Markdown preprocessor such as
[mdoc](https://github.com/scalameta/mdoc). These tools read your Markdown source files, search for code fences,
evaluate them (throwing an error if they don’t compile), and produce a copy of your Markdown files where
code fences have been updated to also include the result of evaluating the Scala expressions.

#### Embedding Snippets

Another approach consists in embedding fragments of Scala source files that are part of a module which
is compiled by your build. For instance, given the following test in file `src/test/ch/epfl/scala/Usage.scala`:

~~~ scala
package ch.epfl.scala

import scalaprops.{Property, Scalaprops}

object Usage extends Scalaprops {

  val testDoNothing =
// #do-nothing
    Property.forAll { x: Int =>
      Example.doNothing(x) == x
    }
// #do-nothing

}
~~~

You can embed the fragment surrounded by the `#do-nothing` identifiers with the `@@snip` Paradox directive,
as shown in the `src/documentation/reference.md` file:

{% highlight markdown %}
# Reference

The `doNothing` function takes anything as parameter and returns it unchanged:

@@snip [Usage.scala]($root$/src/test/scala/ch/epfl/scala/Usage.scala) { #do-nothing }
{% endhighlight %}

The resulting documentation looks like the following:

![](/resources/images/documentation-snippet.png)

### Include API Documentation

It can also be useful to have links to the API documentation (Scaladoc) from your documentation website.

This can be achieved by adding the following lines to your `build.sbt`:

{% highlight scala %}
enablePlugins(SiteScaladocPlugin)
SiteScaladoc / siteSubdirName := "api"
paradoxProperties += ("scaladoc.base_url" -> "api")
{% endhighlight %}

The `SiteScaladocPlugin` is provided by `sbt-site` and includes the API documentation to the generated
website. The second line defines that the API documentation should be published at the `/api` base URL,
and the third line makes this information available to Paradox.

You can then use the `@scaladoc` Paradox directive to include a link to the API documentation of a
particular symbol of your library:

{% highlight markdown %}
Browse the @scaladoc[API documentation](ch.epfl.scala.Example$) for more information.
{% endhighlight %}

The `@scaladoc` directive will produce a link to the `/api/ch/epfl/scala/Example$.html` page.

### Publish Documentation

Add the `sbt-ghpages` plugin to your `project/plugins.sbt`:

~~~ scala
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-ghpages" % "0.6.3")
~~~

And add the following configuration to your `build.sbt`:

{% highlight scala %}
enablePlugins(GhpagesPlugin)
git.remoteRepo := sonatypeProjectHosting.value.get.scmUrl
{% endhighlight %}

Create a `gh-pages` branch in your project repository as explained in the
[sbt-ghpages documentation](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-ghpages#initializing-the-gh-pages-branch).

Finally, publish your site by running the `ghpagesPushSite` sbt task:

~~~
sbt:library-example> ghpagesPushSite
[info] Cloning into '.'...
[info] [gh-pages 2e7f426] updated site
[info]  83 files changed, 8059 insertions(+)
[info]  create mode 100644 .nojekyll
[info]  create mode 100644 api/ch/epfl/index.html
…
[info] To git@github.com:scalacenter/library-example.git
[info]    2d62539..2e7f426  gh-pages -> gh-pages
[success] Total time: 9 s, completed Jan 22, 2019 10:55:15 AM
~~~

Your site should be online at `https://(organization).github.io/(project)`. In our case, you
can browse it at [https://scalacenter.github.io/library-example/](https://scalacenter.github.io/library-example/).

### Continuous Publication

You can extend `.github/workflows/publish.yml` to automatically publish documentation to GitHub pages.
To do so, add another job:

```yml
# .github/workflows/publish.yml
name: Continuous publication

jobs:
  release: # The release job is not changed, you can find it above
  publishSite:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          distribution: temurin
          java-version: 8
          cache: sbt
      - name: Generate site
        run: sbt makeSite
      - uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.3
        with:
          branch: gh-pages
          folder: target/site

```

As usual, cut a release by pushing a Git tag. The CI server will run the tests, publish the binaries and update the
online documentation.

## Welcome Contributors

This section gives you advice on how to make it easier to get people contributing to your project.

### `CONTRIBUTING.md`

Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to your repository, answering the following questions: how to build the project?
What are the coding practices to follow? Where are the tests and how to run them?

For reference, you can read our minimal example of
[`CONTRIBUTING.md` file](https://github.com/scalacenter/library-example/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Issue Labels

We recommend you to label your project issues so that potential contributors can quickly see the scope of
an issue (e.g., “documentation”, “core”, …), it’s level of difficulty (e.g., “good first issue”, “advanced”, …),
or its priority (e.g., “blocker”, “nice to have”, …).

### Code Formatting

Reviewing a pull requests where the substantial changes are diluted in code style changes can be a frustrating
experience. You can avoid that problem by using a code formatter forcing all the contributors to follow a
specific code style.

For instance, to use [scalafmt](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/), add the following line to your `project/plugins.sbt`
file:

~~~ scala
addSbtPlugin("org.scalameta" % "sbt-scalafmt" % "2.4.2")
~~~

In the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, mention that you use that code formatter and encourage users to use the “format
on save” feature of their editor.

In your `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file, add a step checking that the code has been properly formatted:

~~~ yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
# The three periods `...` indicate the parts of file that do not change
# from the snippets above and they are omitted for brevity
jobs:
  ci:
    # ...
    steps:
      # ...
      - name: Code style
        run: sbt scalafmtCheck
~~~

## Evolve

From the user point of view, upgrading to a new version of a library should be a smooth process. Possibly,
it should even be a “non-event”.

Breaking changes and migration steps should be thoroughly documented, and a we recommend following the
[semantic versioning](/overviews/core/binary-compatibility-for-library-authors.html#versioning-scheme---communicating-compatibility-breakages)
policy.

The [MiMa](https://github.com/lightbend/migration-manager) tool can help you checking that you don’t
break this versioning policy. Add the `sbt-mima-plugin` to your build with the following, in your
`project/plugins.sbt` file:

~~~ scala
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe" % "sbt-mima-plugin" % "0.9.2")
~~~

Configure it as follow, in `build.sbt`:

~~~ scala
mimaPreviousArtifacts := previousStableVersion.value.map(organization.value %% name.value % _).toSet
~~~

Last, add the following step to the job `ci` of the `Continuous integration` workflow, in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file:

~~~ yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
# The three periods `...` indicate the parts of file that do not change
# from the snippets above and they are omitted for brevity

# ...
jobs:
  ci:
    # ...
    steps:
      # ...
      - name: Binary compatibility
        run: sbt mimaReportBinaryIssues
~~~

This will check that pull requests don’t make changes that are binary incompatible with the
previous stable version.

We suggest working with the following Git workflow: the `main` branch always receives pull requests
for the next major version (so, binary compatibility checks are disabled, by setting the `mimaPreviousArtifacts`
value to `Set.empty`), and each major version `N` has a corresponding `N.x` branch (e.g., `1.x`, `2.x`, etc.) branch
where the binary compatibility checks are enabled.
