If you are interested in contributing to the API documentation of the Scala
standard library (the documentation generated by Scaladoc), please read 
[Generating Scaladoc]({{ site.baseurl }}/overviews/scaladoc/generate.html) and
[Scaladoc for Library Authors]({{ site.baseurl }}/overviews/scaladoc/basics.html) first.

If you'd like to contribute to the actual Scaladoc documentation generation
tool itself, then please see the
[Hacker Set Up Guide](https://scala-lang.org/contribute/hacker-guide.html#2-set-up)
which covers the steps and workflow necessary work on the Scaladoc tool.

As of Scala 2.13, the Scaladoc tool is maintained but not actively
developed.  Major development of Scaladoc will progress as a part of
Dotty for Scala 3 in the
[Dottydoc](https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/usage/dottydoc.html) tool.
