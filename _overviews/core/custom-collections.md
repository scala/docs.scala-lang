title: Implementing Custom Collections (Scala 2.13)

**Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon and Julien Richard-Foy**

This article shows how to implement custom collection types on top of
the collections framework. It is recommended to first read the article
about the [architecture of the collections]({{ site.baseurl }}/overviews/core/architecture-of-scala-213-collections.html).

What needs to be done if you want to integrate a new collection class,
so that it can profit from all predefined operations with the right
types? In the next few sections you’ll be walked through three examples
that do this, namely capped sequences, sequences of RNA
bases and prefix maps implemented with Patricia tries.

## Capped sequence ##

Say you want to create an immutable collection containing *at most* `n` elements:
if more elements are added then the first elements are removed.

The first task is to find the supertype of our collection: is it
`Seq`, `Set`, `Map` or just `Iterable`? In our case, it is tempting
to choose `Seq` because our collection can contain duplicates and
iteration order is determined by insertion order. However, some
[properties of `Seq`](/overviews/collections/seqs.html) are not satisfied:

{% tabs notCapped_1 %}
{% tab 'Scala 2 and 3' for=notCapped_1 %}
~~~ scala
(xs ++ ys).size == xs.size + ys.size
~~~
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Consequently, the only sensible choice as a base collection type
is `collection.immutable.Iterable`.

### First version of `Capped` class ###

{% tabs capped1_1 class=tabs-scala-version %}
{% tab 'Scala 2' for=capped1_1 %}
~~~ scala
import scala.collection._

class Capped1[A] private (val capacity: Int, val length: Int, offset: Int, elems: Array[Any])
  extends immutable.Iterable[A] { self =>

  def this(capacity: Int) =
    this(capacity, length = 0, offset = 0, elems = Array.ofDim(capacity))

  def appended[B >: A](elem: B): Capped1[B] = {
    val newElems = Array.ofDim[Any](capacity)
    Array.copy(elems, 0, newElems, 0, capacity)
    val (newOffset, newLength) =
      if (length == capacity) {
        newElems(offset) = elem
        ((offset + 1) % capacity, length)
      } else {
        newElems(length) = elem
        (offset, length + 1)
      }
    new Capped1[B](capacity, newLength, newOffset, newElems)
  }

  @`inline` def :+ [B >: A](elem: B): Capped1[B] = appended(elem)

  def apply(i: Int): A = elems((i + offset) % capacity).asInstanceOf[A]

  def iterator: Iterator[A] = new AbstractIterator[A] {
    private var current = 0
    def hasNext = current < self.length
    def next(): A = {
      val elem = self(current)
      current += 1
      elem
    }
  }

  override def className = "Capped1"

}
~~~
{% endtab %}
{% tab 'Scala 3' for=capped1_1 %}
~~~scala
import scala.collection.*

class Capped1[A] private (val capacity: Int, val length: Int, offset: Int, elems: Array[Any])
  extends immutable.Iterable[A]:
  self =>

  def this(capacity: Int) =
    this(capacity, length = 0, offset = 0, elems = Array.ofDim(capacity))

  def appended[B >: A](elem: B): Capped1[B] =
    val newElems = Array.ofDim[Any](capacity)
    Array.copy(elems, 0, newElems, 0, capacity)
    val (newOffset, newLength) =
      if length == capacity then
        newElems(offset) = elem
        ((offset + 1) % capacity, length)
      else
        newElems(length) = elem
        (offset, length + 1)
    Capped1[B](capacity, newLength, newOffset, newElems)
  end appended

  inline def :+ [B >: A](elem: B): Capped1[B] = appended(elem)

  def apply(i: Int): A = elems((i + offset) % capacity).asInstanceOf[A]

  def iterator: Iterator[A] = new AbstractIterator[A]:
    private var current = 0
    def hasNext = current < self.length
    def next(): A =
      val elem = self(current)
      current += 1
      elem
  end iterator

  override def className = "Capped1"
end Capped1
~~~
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The above listing presents the first version of our capped collection
implementation. It will be refined later. The class `Capped1` has a
private constructor that takes the collection capacity, length,
offset (first element index) and the underlying array as parameters.
The public constructor takes only the capacity of the collection. It
sets the length and offset to 0, and uses an empty array of elements.

The `appended` method defines how elements can be appended to a given
`Capped1` collection: it creates a new underlying array of elements,
copies the current elements and adds the new element. As long as the
number of elements does not exceed the `capacity`, the new element
is appended after the previous elements. However, as soon as the
maximal capacity has been reached, the new element replaces the first
element of the collection (at `offset` index).

The `apply` method implements indexed access: it translates the given
index into its corresponding index in the underlying array by adding
the `offset`.

These two methods, `appended` and `apply`, implement the specific
behavior of the `Capped1` collection type. In addition to them, we have
to implement `iterator` to make the generic collection operations
(such as `foldLeft`, `count`, etc.) work on `Capped1` collections.
Here we implement it by using indexed access.

Last, we override `className` to return the name of the collection,
`“Capped1”`. This name is used by the `toString` operation.

Here are some interactions with the `Capped1` collection:

{% tabs capped1_2 %}
{% tab 'Scala 2 and 3' for=capped1_2 %}
~~~ scala
scala> val c0 = new Capped1(capacity = 4)
val c0: Capped1[Nothing] = Capped1()

scala> val c1 = c0 :+ 1 :+ 2 :+ 3
val c1: Capped1[Int] = Capped1(1, 2, 3)

scala> c1.length
val res2: Int = 3

scala> c1.lastOption
val res3: Option[Int] = Some(3)

scala> val c2 = c1 :+ 4 :+ 5 :+ 6
val c2: Capped1[Int] = Capped1(3, 4, 5, 6)

scala> val c3 = c2.take(3)
val c3: collection.immutable.Iterable[Int] = List(3, 4, 5)
~~~
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

You can see that if we try to grow the collection with more than four
elements, the first elements are dropped (see `res4`). The operations
behave as expected except for the last one: after calling `take` we
get back a `List` instead of the expected `Capped1` collection. This
is because all that was done in [class
`Capped1`](#first-version-of-capped-class) was making `Capped1` extend
`immutable.Iterable`. This class has a `take` method
that returns an `immutable.Iterable`, and that’s implemented in terms of
`immutable.Iterable`’s default implementation, `List`. So, that’s what
you were seeing on the last line of the previous interaction.

Now that you understand why things are the way they are, the next
question should be what needs to be done to change them? One way to do
this would be to override the `take` method in class `Capped1`, maybe like
this:

{% tabs take_signature %}
{% tab 'Scala 2 and 3' for=take_signature %}
```scala
def take(count: Int): Capped1 = …
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

This would do the job for `take`. But what about `drop`, or `filter`, or
`init`? In fact there are over fifty methods on collections that return
again a collection. For consistency, all of these would have to be
overridden. This looks less and less like an attractive
option. Fortunately, there is a much easier way to achieve the same
effect, as shown in the next section.

### Second version of `Capped` class ###

{% tabs capped2_1 class=tabs-scala-version %}
{% tab 'Scala 2' for=capped2_1 %}
~~~ scala
import scala.collection._

class Capped2[A] private (val capacity: Int, val length: Int, offset: Int, elems: Array[Any])
  extends immutable.Iterable[A]
    with IterableOps[A, Capped2, Capped2[A]] { self =>

  def this(capacity: Int) = // as before

  def appended[B >: A](elem: B): Capped2[B] = // as before
  @`inline` def :+ [B >: A](elem: B): Capped2[B] = // as before
  def apply(i: Int): A = // as before

  def iterator: Iterator[A] = // as before

  override def className = "Capped2"
  override val iterableFactory: IterableFactory[Capped2] = new Capped2Factory(capacity)
  override protected def fromSpecific(coll: IterableOnce[A]): Capped2[A] = iterableFactory.from(coll)
  override protected def newSpecificBuilder: mutable.Builder[A, Capped2[A]] = iterableFactory.newBuilder
  override def empty: Capped2[A] = iterableFactory.empty

}

class Capped2Factory(capacity: Int) extends IterableFactory[Capped2] {

  def from[A](source: IterableOnce[A]): Capped2[A] =
    (newBuilder[A] ++= source).result()

  def empty[A]: Capped2[A] = new Capped2[A](capacity)

  def newBuilder[A]: mutable.Builder[A, Capped2[A]] =
    new mutable.ImmutableBuilder[A, Capped2[A]](empty) {
      def addOne(elem: A): this.type = { elems = elems :+ elem; this }
    }
}
~~~
{% endtab %}
{% tab 'Scala 3' for=capped2_1 %}
~~~ scala
class Capped2[A] private(val capacity: Int, val length: Int, offset: Int, elems: Array[Any])
  extends immutable.Iterable[A],
    IterableOps[A, Capped2, Capped2[A]]:
  self =>

  def this(capacity: Int) = // as before

  def appended[B >: A](elem: B): Capped2[B] = // as before
  inline def :+[B >: A](elem: B): Capped2[B] = // as before
  def apply(i: Int): A = // as before

  def iterator: Iterator[A] = // as before

  override def className = "Capped2"
  override val iterableFactory: IterableFactory[Capped2] = Capped2Factory(capacity)
  override protected def fromSpecific(coll: IterableOnce[A]): Capped2[A] = iterableFactory.from(coll)
  override protected def newSpecificBuilder: mutable.Builder[A, Capped2[A]] = iterableFactory.newBuilder
  override def empty: Capped2[A] = iterableFactory.empty
end Capped2

class Capped2Factory(capacity: Int) extends IterableFactory[Capped2]:

  def from[A](source: IterableOnce[A]): Capped2[A] =
    (newBuilder[A] ++= source).result()

  def empty[A]: Capped2[A] = Capped2[A](capacity)

  def newBuilder[A]: mutable.Builder[A, Capped2[A]] =
    new mutable.ImmutableBuilder[A, Capped2[A]](empty):
      def addOne(elem: A): this.type =
        elems = elems :+ elem; this
end Capped2Factory
~~~
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The Capped class needs to inherit not only from `Iterable`, but also
from its implementation trait `IterableOps`. This is shown in the
above listing of class `Capped2`. The new implementation differs
from the previous one in only two aspects. First, class `Capped2`
now also extends `IterableOps[A, Capped2, Capped2[A]]`. Second,
its `iterableFactory` member is overridden to return an
`IterableFactory[Capped2]`. As explained in the
previous sections, the `IterableOps` trait implements all concrete
methods of `Iterable` in a generic way. For instance, the
return type of methods like `take`, `drop`, `filter` or `init`
is the third type parameter passed to class `IterableOps`, i.e.,
in class `Capped2`, it is `Capped2[A]`. Similarly, the return
type of methods like `map`, `flatMap` or `concat` is defined
by the second type parameter passed to class `IterableOps`,
i.e., in class `Capped2`, it is `Capped2` itself.

Operations returning `Capped2[A]` collections are implemented in `IterableOps`
in terms of the `fromSpecific` and `newSpecificBuilder` operations. The
`immutable.Iterable[A]` parent class implements the `fromSpecific` and
`newSpecificBuilder` such that they only return `immutable.Iterable[A]`
collections instead of the expected `Capped2[A]` collections. Consequently,
we override the `fromSpecific` and `newSpecificBuilder` operations to
make them return a `Capped2[A]` collection. Another inherited operation
returning a too general type is `empty`. We override it to return a
`Capped2[A]` collection too. All these overrides simply forward to the
collection factory referred to by the `iterableFactory` member, whose value
is an instance of class `Capped2Factory`.

The `Capped2Factory` class provides convenient factory methods to build
collections. Eventually, these methods delegate to the `empty` operation,
which builds an empty `Capped2` instance, and `newBuilder`, which uses the
`appended` operation to grow a `Capped2` collection.

With the refined implementation of the [`Capped2` class](#second-version-of-capped-class),
the transformation operations work now as expected, and the
`Capped2Factory` class provides seamless conversions from other collections:

{% tabs capped2_2 %}
{% tab 'Scala 2 and 3' for=capped2_2 %}
~~~ scala
scala> object Capped extends Capped2Factory(capacity = 4)
defined object Capped

scala> Capped(1, 2, 3)
val res0: Capped2[Int] = Capped2(1, 2, 3)

scala> res0.take(2)
val res1: Capped2[Int] = Capped2(1, 2)

scala> res0.filter(x => x % 2 == 1)
val res2: Capped2[Int] = Capped2(1, 3)

scala> res0.map(x => x * x)
val res3: Capped2[Int] = Capped2(1, 4, 9)

scala> List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).to(Capped)
val res4: Capped2[Int] = Capped2(2, 3, 4, 5)
~~~
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

This implementation now behaves correctly, but we can still improve
a few things:

- since our collection is strict, we can take advantage
  of the better performance offered by
  strict implementations of transformation operations,
- since our `fromSpecific`, `newSpecificBuilder` and `empty`
  operation just forward to the `iterableFactory` member,
  we can use the `IterableFactoryDefaults` trait that provides
  such implementations.

~~~
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

That is it. The final [`Capped` class](#final-version-of-capped-class):

- extends the `StrictOptimizedIterableOps` trait, which overrides all
  transformation operations to take advantage of strict builders,
- extends the `IterableFactoryDefaults` trait, which overrides the
  `fromSpecific`, `newSpecificBuilder` and `empty` operations to forward
  to the `iterableFactory`,
- overrides a few operations for performance: the `view` now uses
  indexed access, and the `iterator` delegates to the view. The
  `knownSize` operation is also overridden because the size is always
  known.

Its implementation requires a little bit of protocol. In essence, you
have to inherit from the `Ops` template trait in addition to just
inheriting from a collection type, override the `iterableFactory`
member to return a more specific factory, and finally implement abstract
methods (such as `iterator` in our case), if any.

## RNA sequences ##

To start with the second example, say you want to create a new immutable sequence type for RNA strands.
These are sequences of bases A (adenine), U (uracil), G (guanine), and C
(cytosine). The definitions for bases are set up as shown in the
listing of RNA bases below:

{% tabs Base_1 class=tabs-scala-version %}
{% tab 'Scala 2' for=Base_1 %}
~~~ scala
abstract class Base
case object A extends Base
case object U extends Base
case object G extends Base
case object C extends Base

object Base {
  val fromInt: Int => Base = Array(A, U, G, C)
  val toInt: Base => Int = Map(A -> 0, U -> 1, G -> 2, C -> 3)
}
~~~

Every base is defined as a case object that inherits from a common
abstract class `Base`. The `Base` class has a companion object that
defines two functions that map between bases and the integers 0 to 3.

You can see in the above example two different ways to use collections
to implement these functions. The `toInt` function is implemented as a
`Map` from `Base` values to integers. The reverse function, `fromInt`, is
implemented as an array. This makes use of the fact that both maps and
arrays *are* functions because they inherit from the `Function1` trait.

{% endtab %}
{% tab 'Scala 3' for=Base_1 %}
~~~ scala
enum Base:
  case A, U, G, C

object Base:
  val fromInt: Int => Base = values
  val toInt: Base => Int = _.ordinal
~~~

Every base is defined as a case of the `Base` enum. `Base` has a companion object
that defines two functions that map between bases and the integers 0 to 3.

The `toInt` function is implemented by delegating to the `ordinal` method defined on `Base`,
which is automatically defined because `Base` is an enum. Each enum case will have a unique `ordinal` value.
The reverse function, `fromInt`, is implemented as an array. This makes use of the fact that
arrays *are* functions because they inherit from the `Function1` trait.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The next task is to define a class for strands of RNA. Conceptually, a
strand of RNA is simply a `Seq[Base]`. However, RNA strands can get
quite long, so it makes sense to invest some work in a compact
representation. Because there are only four bases, a base can be
identified with two bits, and you can therefore store sixteen bases as
two-bit values in an integer. The idea, then, is to construct a
specialized subclass of `Seq[Base]`, which uses this packed
representation.

    new RNA1(groups, buf.length)

~~~
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The [RNA strands class listing](#first-version-of-rna-strands-class) above
presents the first version of this
class. The class `RNA1` has a constructor that
takes an array of `Int`s as its first argument. This array contains the
packed RNA data, with sixteen bases in each element, except for the
last array element, which might be partially filled. The second
argument, `length`, specifies the total number of bases on the array
(and in the sequence). Class `RNA1` extends `IndexedSeq[Base]` and
`IndexedSeqOps[Base, IndexedSeq, RNA1]`. These traits define the following
abstract methods:

- `length`, automatically implemented by defining a parametric field of
  the same name,
- `apply` (indexing method), implemented by first extracting an integer value
  from the `groups` array, then extracting the correct two-bit number from that
  integer using right shift (`>>`) and mask (`&`). The private constants `S`,
  `N`, and `M` come from the `RNA1` companion object. `S` specifies the size of
  each packet (i.e., two); `N` specifies the number of two-bit packets per
  integer; and `M` is a bit mask that isolates the lowest `S` bits in a
  word.

We also override the following members used by transformation operations
such as `filter` and `take`:

- `fromSpecific`, implemented by the `fromSeq` method of the `RNA1`
  companion object,
- `newSpecificBuilder`, implemented by using the default `IndexedSeq` builder
  and transforming its result into an `RNA1` with the `mapResult` method.

Note that the constructor of class `RNA1` is `private`. This means that
clients cannot create `RNA1` sequences by calling `new`, which makes
sense, because it hides the representation of `RNA1` sequences in terms
of packed arrays from the user. If clients cannot see what the
representation details of RNA sequences are, it becomes possible to
change these representation details at any point in the future without
affecting client code. In other words, this design achieves a good
decoupling of the interface of RNA sequences and its
implementation. However, if constructing an RNA sequence with `new` is
impossible, there must be some other way to create new RNA sequences,
else the whole class would be rather useless. In fact there are two
alternatives for RNA sequence creation, both provided by the `RNA1`
companion object. The first way is method `fromSeq`, which converts a
given sequence of bases (i.e., a value of type `Seq[Base]`) into an
instance of class `RNA1`. The `fromSeq` method does this by packing all
the bases contained in its argument sequence into an array, then
calling `RNA1`'s private constructor with that array and the length of
the original sequence as arguments. This makes use of the fact that a
private constructor of a class is visible in the class's companion
object.

The second way to create an `RNA1` value is provided by the `apply` method
in the `RNA1` object. It takes a variable number of `Base` arguments and
simply forwards them as a sequence to `fromSeq`. Here are the two
creation schemes in action:

{% tabs RNA1_2 %}
{% tab 'Scala 2 and 3' for=RNA1_2 %}

```scala
scala> val xs = List(A, G, U, A)
val xs: List[Base] = List(A, G, U, A)

scala> RNA1.fromSeq(xs)
val res1: RNA1 = RNA1(A, G, U, A)

scala> val rna1 = RNA1(A, U, G, G, C)
val rna1: RNA1 = RNA1(A, U, G, G, C)
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Also note that the type parameters of the `IndexedSeqOps` trait that
we inherit from are: `Base`, `IndexedSeq` and `RNA1`. The first one
stands for the type of elements, the second one stands for the
type constructor used by transformation operations that return
a collection with a different type of elements, and the third one
stands for the type used by transformation operations that return
a collection with the same type of elements. In our case, it is
worth noting that the second one is `IndexedSeq` whereas the
third one is `RNA1`. This means that operations like `map` or
`flatMap` return an `IndexedSeq`, whereas operations like `take` or
`filter` return an `RNA1`.

Here is an example showing the usage of `take` and `filter`:

{% tabs RNA1_3 %}
{% tab 'Scala 2 and 3' for=RNA1_3 %}

```scala
scala> val rna1_2 = rna1.take(3)
val rna1_2: RNA1 = RNA1(A, U, G)

scala> val rna1_3 = rna1.filter(_ != U)
val rna1_3: RNA1 = RNA1(A, G, G, C)
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Dealing with map and friends ###

However, transformation operations that return a collection with a
different element type always return an `IndexedSeq`.

How should these
methods be adapted to RNA strands? The desired behavior would be to get
back an RNA strand when mapping bases to bases or appending two RNA strands
with `++`:

{% tabs RNA1_4 %}
{% tab 'Scala 2 and 3' for=RNA1_4 %}

```scala
scala> val rna = RNA(A, U, G, G, C)
val rna: RNA = RNA(A, U, G, G, C)

scala> rna.map { case A => U case b => b }
val res7: RNA = RNA(U, U, G, G, C)

scala> rna ++ rna
val res8: RNA = RNA(A, U, G, G, C, A, U, G, G, C)
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

On the other hand, mapping bases to some other type over an RNA strand
cannot yield another RNA strand because the new elements have the
wrong type. It has to yield a sequence instead. In the same vein
appending elements that are not of type `Base` to an RNA strand can
yield a general sequence, but it cannot yield another RNA strand.

{% tabs RNA1_5 %}
{% tab 'Scala 2 and 3' for=RNA1_5 %}

```scala
scala> rna.map(Base.toInt)
val res2: IndexedSeq[Int] = Vector(0, 1, 2, 2, 3)

scala> rna ++ List("missing", "data")
val res3: IndexedSeq[java.lang.Object] =
  Vector(A, U, G, G, C, missing, data)
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

This is what you'd expect in the ideal case. But this is not what the
[`RNA1` class](#first-version-of-rna-strands-class) provides. In fact, all
examples will return instances of `Vector`, not just the last two. If you run
the first three commands above with instances of this class you obtain:

{% tabs RNA1_6 %}
{% tab 'Scala 2 and 3' for=RNA1_6 %}

```scala
scala> val rna1 = RNA1(A, U, G, G, C)
val rna1: RNA1 = RNA1(A, U, G, G, C)

scala> rna1.map { case A => U case b => b }
val res0: IndexedSeq[Base] = Vector(U, U, G, G, C)

scala> rna1 ++ rna1
val res1: IndexedSeq[Base] = Vector(A, U, G, G, C, A, U, G, G, C)
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

So the result of `map` and `++` is never an RNA strand, even if the
element type of the generated collection is `Base`. To see how to do
better, it pays to have a close look at the signature of the `map`
method (or of `++`, which has a similar signature). The `map` method is
originally defined in class `scala.collection.IterableOps` with the
following signature:

{% tabs map_signature %}
{% tab 'Scala 2 and 3' for=map_signature %}
```scala
def map[B](f: A => B): CC[B]
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Here `A` is the type of elements of the collection, and `CC` is the type
constructor passed as a second parameter to the `IterableOps` trait.

In our `RNA1` implementation, this `CC` type constructor is `IndexedSeq`,
this is why we always get a `Vector` as a result.

To address this shortcoming, you need to overload the methods that
return an `IndexedSeq[B]` for the case where `B` is known to be `Base`,
to return an `RNA2` instead.

Compared to [class `RNA1`](#first-version-of-rna-strands-class)
we added overloads for methods `concat`, `appended`, `appendedAll`, `prepended`,
`prependedAll`, `map` and `flatMap`.

This implementation now behaves correctly, but we can still improve a few things. Since our
collection is strict, we could take advantage of the better performance offered by strict builders
in transformation operations.
Also, if we try to convert an `Iterable[Base]` into an `RNA2` it fails:

The final [`RNA` class](#final-version-of-rna-strands-class):

- extends the `StrictOptimizedSeqOps` trait, which overrides all transformation
  operations to take advantage of strict builders,
- uses utility operations provided by the `StrictOptimizedSeqOps` trait such as
  `strictOptimizedConcat` to implement overload of transformation operations that
  return an `RNA` collection,
- has a companion object that extends `SpecificIterableFactory[Base, RNA]`, which makes
  it possible to use it as a parameter of a `to` call (to convert any collection
  of bases to an `RNA`, e.g. `List(U, A, G, C).to(RNA)`),
- moves the `newSpecificBuilder` and `fromSpecific` implementations
  to the companion object.

The discussion so far centered on the minimal amount of definitions
needed to define new sequences with methods that obey certain
types. But in practice you might also want to add new functionality to
your sequences or to override existing methods for better
efficiency. An example of this is the overridden `iterator` method in
class `RNA`. `iterator` is an important method in its own right because it
implements loops over collections. Furthermore, many other collection
methods are implemented in terms of `iterator`. So it makes sense to
invest some effort optimizing the method's implementation. The
standard implementation of `iterator` in `IndexedSeq` will simply select
every `i`'th element of the collection using `apply`, where `i` ranges from
0 to the collection's length minus one. So this standard
implementation selects an array element and unpacks a base from it
once for every element in an RNA strand. The overriding `iterator` in
class `RNA` is smarter than that. For every selected array element it
immediately applies the given function to all bases contained in
it. So the effort for array selection and bit unpacking is much
reduced.

## Prefix map ##

As a third example you'll learn how to integrate a new kind of mutable map
into the collection framework. The idea is to implement a mutable map
with `String` as the type of keys by a "Patricia trie". The term
*Patricia* is in fact an abbreviation for "Practical Algorithm to
Retrieve Information Coded in Alphanumeric" and *trie* comes from
re*trie*val (a trie is also called a radix tree or prefix tree).
The idea is to store a set or a map as a tree where subsequent
characters in a search key
uniquely determine a path through the tree. For instance a Patricia trie
storing the strings "abc", "abd", "al", "all" and "xy" would look
like this:

A sample patricia trie:
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/resources/images/patricia.png" alt="Patricia trie" width="550">

To find the node corresponding to the string "abc" in this trie,
simply follow the subtree labeled "a", proceed from there to the
subtree labelled "b", to finally reach its subtree labelled "c". If
the Patricia trie is used as a map, the value that's associated with a
key is stored in the nodes that can be reached by the key. If it is a
set, you simply store a marker saying that the node is present in the
set.

Patricia tries support very efficient lookups and updates. Another
nice feature is that they support selecting a subcollection by giving
a prefix. For instance, in the patricia tree above you can obtain the
sub-collection of all keys that start with an "a" simply by following
the "a" link from the root of the tree.

Based on these ideas we will now walk you through the implementation
of a map that's implemented as a Patricia trie. We call the map a
`PrefixMap`, which means that it provides a method `withPrefix` that
selects a submap of all keys starting with a given prefix. We'll first
define a prefix map with the keys shown in the running example:

{% tabs prefixMap_1 %}
{% tab 'Scala 2 and 3' for=prefixMap_1 %}

```scala
scala> val m = PrefixMap("abc" -> 0, "abd" -> 1, "al" -> 2,
  "all" -> 3, "xy" -> 4)
val m: PrefixMap[Int] = PrefixMap((abc,0), (abd,1), (al,2), (all,3), (xy,4))
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Then calling `withPrefix` on `m` will yield another prefix map:

{% tabs prefixMap_2 %}
{% tab 'Scala 2 and 3' for=prefixMap_2 %}

```scala
scala> m.withPrefix("a")
val res14: PrefixMap[Int] = PrefixMap((bc,0), (bd,1), (l,2), (ll,3))
```

The previous listing shows the definition of `PrefixMap`. The map has
keys of type `String` and the values are of parametric type `A`. It extends
`mutable.Map[String, A]` and `mutable.MapOps[String, A, mutable.Map, PrefixMap[A]]`.
You have seen this pattern already for sequences in the
RNA strand example; then as now inheriting an implementation class
such as `MapOps` serves to get the right result type for
transformations such as `filter`.

A prefix map node has two mutable fields: `suffixes` and `value`. The
`value` field contains an optional value that's associated with the
node. It is initialized to `None`. The `suffixes` field contains a map
from characters to `PrefixMap` values. It is initialized to the empty
map.

You might ask why we picked an immutable map as the implementation
type for `suffixes`? Would not a mutable map have been more standard,
since `PrefixMap` as a whole is also mutable? The answer is that
immutable maps that contain only a few elements are very efficient in
both space and execution time. For instance, maps that contain fewer
than 5 elements are represented as a single object. By contrast, the
standard mutable map is a `HashMap`, which typically occupies around 80
bytes, even if it is empty. So if small collections are common, it's
better to pick immutable over mutable. In the case of Patricia tries,
we'd expect that most nodes except the ones at the very top of the
tree would contain only a few successors. So storing these successors
in an immutable map is likely to be more efficient.

Now have a look at the first method that needs to be implemented for a
map: `get`. The algorithm is as follows: To get the value associated
with the empty string in a prefix map, simply select the optional
`value` stored in the root of the tree (the current map).
Otherwise, if the key string is
not empty, try to select the submap corresponding to the first
character of the string. If that yields a map, follow up by looking up
the remainder of the key string after its first character in that
map. If the selection fails, the key is not stored in the map, so
return with `None`. The combined selection over an option value `opt` is
elegantly expressed using `opt.flatMap(x => f(x))`. When applied to an
optional value that is `None`, it returns `None`. Otherwise `opt` is
`Some(x)` and the function `f` is applied to the encapsulated value `x`,
yielding a new option, which is returned by the flatmap.

The next two methods to implement for a mutable map are `addOne` and `subtractOne`.

The `subtractOne` method is very similar to `get`, except that before returning
any associated value, the field containing that value is set to
`None`. The `addOne` method first calls `withPrefix` to navigate to the tree
node that needs to be updated, then sets the `value` field of that node
to the given value. The `withPrefix` method navigates through the tree,
creating sub-maps as necessary if some prefix of characters is not yet
contained as a path in the tree.

The last abstract method to implement for a mutable map is
`iterator`. This method needs to produce an iterator that yields all
key/value pairs stored in the map. For any given prefix map this
iterator is composed of the following parts: First, if the map
contains a defined value, `Some(x)`, in the `value` field at its root,
then `("", x)` is the first element returned from the
iterator. Furthermore, the iterator needs to traverse the iterators of
all submaps stored in the `suffixes` field, but it needs to add a
character in front of every key string returned by those
iterators. More precisely, if `m` is the submap reached from the root
through a character `chr`, and `(s, v)` is an element returned from
`m.iterator`, then the root's iterator will return `(chr +: s, v)`
instead. This logic is implemented quite concisely as a concatenation
of two `for` expressions in the implementation of the `iterator` method in
`PrefixMap`. The first `for` expression iterates over `value.iterator`. This
makes use of the fact that `Option` values define an iterator method
that returns either no element, if the option value is `None`, or
exactly one element `x`, if the option value is `Some(x)`.

However, in all these cases, to build the right kind of collection
you need to start with an empty collection of that kind. This is
provided by the `empty` method, which simply returns a fresh `PrefixMap`.

We'll now turn to the companion object `PrefixMap`. In fact, it is not
strictly necessary to define this companion object, as class `PrefixMap`
can stand well on its own. The main purpose of object `PrefixMap` is to
define some convenience factory methods. It also defines an implicit
conversion to `Factory` for a better interoperability with other
collections. This conversion is triggered when one writes, for instance,
`List("foo" -> 3).to(PrefixMap)`. The `to` operation takes a `Factory`
as parameter but the `PrefixMap` companion object does not extend `Factory` (and it
can not because a `Factory` fixes the type of collection elements,
whereas `PrefixMap` has a polymorphic type of values).

The two convenience methods are `empty` and `apply`. The same methods are
present for all other collections in Scala's collection framework, so
it makes sense to define them here, too. With the two methods, you can
write `PrefixMap` literals like you do for any other collection:

{% tabs prefixMap_4 %}
{% tab 'Scala 2 and 3' for=prefixMap_4 %}

```scala
scala> PrefixMap("hello" -> 5, "hi" -> 2)
val res0: PrefixMap[Int] = PrefixMap(hello -> 5, hi -> 2)

scala> res0 += "foo" -> 3
val res1: res0.type = PrefixMap(hello -> 5, hi -> 2, foo -> 3)
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Summary ##

To summarize, if you want to fully integrate a new collection class
into the framework you need to pay attention to the following points:

1. Decide whether the collection should be mutable or immutable.
2. Pick the right base traits for the collection.
3. Inherit from the right implementation trait to implement most
   collection operations.
4. Overload desired operations that do not return, by default, a
   collection as specific as they could. A complete list of such
   operations is given as an appendix.

You have now seen how Scala's collections are built and how you can
add new kinds of collections. Because of Scala's rich support for
abstraction, each new collection type has a large number of
methods without having to reimplement them all over again.

## Appendix: Methods to overload to support the “same result type” principle ##

You want to add overloads to specialize transformation operations such that they return a more specific result type. Examples are:
- `map`, on `StringOps`, when the mapping function returns a `Char`, should return a `String` (instead of an `IndexedSeq`),
- `map`, on `Map`, when the mapping function returns a pair, should return a `Map` (instead of an `Iterable`),
- `map`, on `SortedSet`, when an implicit `Ordering` is available for the resulting element type, should return a
`SortedSet` (instead of a `Set`).

Typically, this happens when the collection fixes some type parameter of its template trait. For instance in
the case of the `RNA` collection type, we fix the element type to `Base`, and in the case of the `PrefixMap[A]`
collection type, we fix the type of keys to `String`.

The following table lists transformation operations that might return an undesirably wide type. You might want to overload
these operations to return a more specific type.

 Collection    | Operations
---------------|--------------
`Iterable`     | `map`, `flatMap`, `collect`, `scanLeft`, `scanRight`, `groupMap`, `concat`, `zip`, `zipAll`, `unzip`
`Seq`          | `prepended`, `appended`, `prependedAll`, `appendedAll`, `padTo`, `patch`
`immutable.Seq`| `updated`
`SortedSet`    | `map`, `flatMap`, `collect`, `zip`
`Map`          | `map`, `flatMap`, `collect`, `concat`
`immutable.Map`| `updated`, `transform`
`SortedMap`    | `map`, `flatMap`, `collect`, `concat`
`immutable.SortedMap` | `updated`

## Appendix: Cross-building custom collections ##

Since the new internal API of the Scala 2.13 collections is very different from the previous
collections API, authors of custom collection types should use separate source directories
(per Scala version) to define them.

With sbt you can achieve this by adding the following setting to your project:

~~~ scala
// Adds a `src/main/scala-2.13+` source directory for Scala 2.13 and newer
// and a `src/main/scala-2.13-` source directory for Scala version older than 2.13
unmanagedSourceDirectories in Compile += {
  val sourceDir = (sourceDirectory in Compile).value
  CrossVersion.partialVersion(scalaVersion.value) match {
    case Some((2, n)) if n >= 13 => sourceDir / "scala-2.13+"
    case _                       => sourceDir / "scala-2.13-"
  }
}
~~~

And then you can define a Scala 2.13 compatible implementation of your collection
in the `src/main/scala-2.13+` source directory, and an implementation for the
previous Scala versions in the `src/main/scala-2.13-` source directory.

You can see how this has been put in practice in
[scalacheck](https://github.com/rickynils/scalacheck/pull/411) and
[scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/pull/1730).
