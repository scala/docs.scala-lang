Scala lets you write code in an object-oriented programming (OOP) style, a functional programming (FP) style, and also in a hybrid style---using both approaches in combination.
[As Martin Odersky has stated](https://twitter.com/alexelcu/status/996408359514525696), the essence of Scala is a fusion of functional and object-oriented programming in a typed setting:

- Functions for the logic
- Objects for the modularity

This chapter assumes that youâ€™re comfortable with OOP and less comfortable with FP, so it provides a gentle introduction to several main functional programming concepts:

- What is functional programming?
- Immutable values
- Pure functions
- Functions are values
- Functional error handling
