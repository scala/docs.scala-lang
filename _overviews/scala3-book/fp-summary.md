This chapter provides a high-level introduction to functional programming in Scala.
The topics covered are:

- What is functional programming?
- Immutable values
- Pure functions
- Functions are values
- Functional error handling

As mentioned, functional programming is a big topic, so all we can do in this book is to touch on these introductory concepts.
See the [Reference documentation][reference] for more details.
