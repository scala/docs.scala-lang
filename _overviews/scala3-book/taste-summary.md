In the previous sections you saw:

- How to use the Scala REPL
- How to create variables with `val` and `var`
- Some common data types
- Control structures
- How to model the real world using OOP and FP styles
- How to create and use methods
- How to use lambdas (anonymous functions) and higher-order functions
- How to use objects for several purposes
- An introduction to [contextual abstraction][contextual]

We also mentioned that if you prefer using a browser-based playground environment instead of the Scala REPL, you can also use [Scastie.scala-lang.org](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/?target=dotty) or [ScalaFiddle.io](https://scalafiddle.io).

Scala has even more features that aren’t covered in this whirlwind tour.
See the remainder of this book and the [Reference documentation][reference] for many more details.
