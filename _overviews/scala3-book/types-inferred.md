As with other statically typed programming languages, in Scala you can _declare_ a type when creating a new variable:

{% tabs xy %}
{% tab 'Scala 2 and 3' %}
```scala
val x: Int = 1
val y: Double = 1
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

In those examples the types are _explicitly_ declared to be `Int` and `Double`, respectively.
However, in Scala you generally don’t have to declare the type when defining value binders:

{% tabs abm %}
{% tab 'Scala 2 and 3' %}
```scala
val a = 1
val b = List(1, 2, 3)
val m = Map(1 -> "one", 2 -> "two")
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

When you do this, Scala _infers_ the types, as shown in the following REPL interaction:

{% tabs abm2 %}
{% tab 'Scala 2 and 3' %}
```scala
scala> val a = 1
val a: Int = 1

scala> val b = List(1, 2, 3)
val b: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3)

scala> val m = Map(1 -> "one", 2 -> "two")
val m: Map[Int, String] = Map(1 -> one, 2 -> two)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Indeed, most variables are defined this way, and Scala’s ability to automatically infer types is one feature that makes it _feel_ like a dynamically typed language.
