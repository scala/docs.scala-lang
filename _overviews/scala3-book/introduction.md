Welcome to the Scala 3 Book.
The goal of this book is to provide an informal introduction to the Scala language.
It touches on all Scala topics, in a relatively light manner.
If at any time while you’re reading this book and want more information on a specific feature, you’ll find links to our [_Reference_ documentation][reference], which covers many new features of the Scala language in more detail.

Over the course of this book, we hope to demonstrate that Scala is a beautiful, expressive programming language, with a clean, modern syntax, which supports functional programming (FP) and object-oriented programming (OOP), and that provides a safe static type system.
Scala’s syntax, grammar, and features have been re-thought, debated in an open process, and updated in 2020 to be clearer and easier to understand than ever before.

The book begins with a whirlwind tour of many of Scala’s features in the [“A Taste of Scala” section][taste].
After that tour, the sections that follow it provide more details on those language features.
