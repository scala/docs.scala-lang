Under certain circumstances, you can omit some parameters of method calls that are considered repetitive.

Those parameters are called _Context Parameters_ because they are inferred by the compiler from the context surrounding the method call.

For instance, consider a program that sorts a list of addresses by two criteria: the city name and then street name.

```scala
val addresses: List[Address] = ...

addresses.sortBy(address => (address.city, address.street))
```

The `sortBy` method takes a function that returns, for every address, the value to compare it with the other addresses.
In this case, we pass a function that returns a pair containing the city name and the street name.

Note that we only indicate _what_ to compare, but not _how_ to perform the comparison.
How does the sorting algorithm know how to compare pairs of `String`?

Actually, the `sortBy` method takes a second parameter---a context parameter---that is inferred by the compiler.
It does not appear in the above example because it is supplied by the compiler.

This second parameter implements the _how_ to compare.
It is convenient to omit it because we know `String`s are generally compared using the lexicographic order.

However, it is also possible to pass it explicitly:

```scala
addresses.sortBy(address => (address.city, address.street))(using Ordering.Tuple2(Ordering.String, Ordering.String))
```

In this case, the `Ordering.Tuple2(Ordering.String, Ordering.String)` instance is exactly the one that is otherwise inferred by the compiler.
In other words both examples produce the same program.

_Contextual Abstractions_ are used to avoid repetition of code.
They help developers write pieces of code that are extensible and concise at the same time.
