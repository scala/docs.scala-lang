In Scala 2, _methods_ can be defined inside classes, traits, objects, case classes, and case objects.
But it gets better: In Scala 3 they can also be defined _outside_ any of those constructs; we say that they are "top-level" definitions, since they are not nested in another definition.
In short, methods can now be defined anywhere.

Many features of methods are demonstrated in the next section.
Because `main` methods require a little more explanation, theyâ€™re described in the separate section that follows.
