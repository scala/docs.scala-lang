In Scala 2, _methods_ can be defined inside classes, traits, objects, case classes, and case objects.
But it gets better: In Scala 3 they can also be defined _outside_ any of those constructs with a new feature named Toplevel definitions.
In short, methods can now be defined anywhere.

Many features of methods are demonstrated in the next section.
Because `main` methods require a little more explanation, they’re described in the separate section that follows.
