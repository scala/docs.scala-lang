Scala has several other advanced types that are not shown in this book, including:

- Type lambdas
- Match types
- Existential types
- Higher-kinded types
- Singleton types
- Refinement types
- Kind polymorphism

For more details on most of these types, refer to the [Scala 3 Reference documentation][reference]. 
For singleton types see the [literal types](https://scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/3.4/03-types.html#literal-types) section of the Scala 3 spec, 
and for refinement types, see the [refined types](https://scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/3.4/03-types.html) section.
