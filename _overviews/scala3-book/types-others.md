Scala has several other advanced types that are not shown in this book, including:

- Type lambdas
- Match types
- Existential types
- Higher-kinded types
- Singleton types
- Refinement types
- Kind polymorphism

For more details on most of these types, see the [Scala 3 Reference documentation][reference].
For more details on singleton types and refinement types, see the Scala 3 [specification of types](https://scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/3.4/03-types.html).
