This chapter introduces the most common Scala 3 collections and their accompanying methods.
Scala comes with a wealth of collections types, but you can go a long way by starting with just a few of them, and later using the others as needed.
Similarly, each type has dozens of methods to make your life easier, but you can achieve a lot by starting with just a handful of them.

Therefore, this section introduces and demonstrates the most common collections types and methods that you’ll need to get started.
