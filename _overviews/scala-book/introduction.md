In these pages, *Scala Book* provides a quick introduction and overview of the Scala programming language. The book is written in an informal style, and consists of more than 50 small lessons. Each lesson is long enough to give you an idea of how the language features in that lesson work, but short enough that you can read it in fifteen minutes or less.

One note before beginning:

- In regards to programming style, most Scala programmers indent their code with two spaces, but we use four spaces because we think it makes the code easier to read, especially in a book format.
