The [Seq](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/Seq.html) trait represents sequences. A sequence is a kind of iterable that has a `length` and whose elements have fixed index positions, starting from `0`.

The operations on sequences, summarized in the table below, fall into the following categories:

* **Indexing and length** operations `apply`, `isDefinedAt`, `length`, `indices`, and `lengthCompare`. For a `Seq`, the `apply` operation means indexing; hence a sequence of type `Seq[T]` is a partial function that takes an `Int` argument (an index) and which yields a sequence element of type `T`. In other words `Seq[T]` extends `PartialFunction[Int, T]`. The elements of a sequence are indexed from zero up to the `length` of the sequence minus one. The `length` method on sequences is an alias of the `size` method of general collections. The `lengthCompare` method allows you to compare the lengths of a sequences with an Int or with an `Iterable` even if the sequences has infinite length.
* **Index search operations** `indexOf`, `lastIndexOf`, `indexOfSlice`, `lastIndexOfSlice`, `indexWhere`, `lastIndexWhere`, `segmentLength`, which return the index of an element equal to a given value or matching some predicate.
* **Addition operations** `prepended`, `prependedAll`, `appended`, `appendedAll`, `padTo`, which return new sequences obtained by adding elements at the front or the end of a sequence.
* **Update operations** `updated`, `patch`, which return a new sequence obtained by replacing some elements of the original sequence.
* **Sorting operations** `sorted`, `sortWith`, `sortBy`, which sort sequence elements according to various criteria.
* **Reversal operations** `reverse`, `reverseIterator`, which yield or process sequence elements in reverse order.
* **Comparisons** `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `contains`, `containsSlice`, `corresponds`, `search`, which relate two sequences or search an element in a sequence.
* **Multiset** operations `intersect`, `diff`, `distinct`, `distinctBy`, which perform set-like operations on the elements of two sequences or remove duplicates.

If a sequence is mutable, it offers in addition a side-effecting `update` method, which lets sequence elements be updated. As always in Scala, syntax like `seq(idx) = elem` is just a shorthand for `seq.update(idx, elem)`, so `update` gives convenient assignment syntax for free. Note the difference between `update` and `updated`. `update` changes a sequence element in place, and is only available for mutable sequences. `updated` is available for all sequences and always returns a new sequence instead of modifying the original.

### Operations in Class Seq ###

| WHAT IT IS  	  	    | WHAT IT DOES				     |
| ------       	       	    | ------					     |
|  **Indexing and Length:** |						     |
|  `xs(i)`    	  	    |(or, written out, `xs.apply(i)`). The element of `xs` at index `i`.|
|  `xs.isDefinedAt(i)`	    |Tests whether `i` is contained in `xs.indices`.|
|  `xs.length`	    	    |The length of the sequence (same as `size`).|
|  `xs.lengthCompare(n)`    |Returns `-1` if `xs` is shorter than `n`, `+1` if it is longer, and `0` if it is of length `n`. Works even if the sequence is infinite, for example `LazyList.from(1).lengthCompare(42)` returns a positive value.|
|  `xs.indices`	     	    |The index range of `xs`, extending from `0` to `xs.length - 1`.|
|  **Index Search:**        |						     |
|  `xs.indexOf(x)`   	    |The index of the first element in `xs` equal to `x` (several variants exist).|
|  `xs.lastIndexOf(x)`       |The index of the last element in `xs` equal to `x` (several variants exist).|
|  `xs.indexOfSlice(ys)`     |The first index of `xs` such that successive elements starting from that index form the sequence `ys`.|
|  `xs.lastIndexOfSlice(ys)` |The last index of `xs` such that successive elements starting from that index form the sequence `ys`.|
|  `xs.indexWhere(p)`   	    |The index of the first element in xs that satisfies `p` (several variants exist).|
|  `xs.segmentLength(p, i)`|The length of the longest uninterrupted segment of elements in `xs`, starting with `xs(i)`, that all satisfy the predicate `p`.|
|  **Additions:** 	    |						     |
|  `xs.prepended(x)`<br>or `x +: xs` 	    	    |A new sequence that consists of `x` prepended to `xs`.|

|  `xs.appendedAll(ys)`<br>or `xs :++ ys`  	    |A new sequence that consists of all the elements of `ys` appended to `xs`.|
|  `xs.padTo(len, x)` 	    |The sequence resulting from appending the value `x` to `xs` until length `len` is reached.|
|  **Updates:** 	    |						     |
|  `xs.patch(i, ys, r)`    |The sequence resulting from replacing `r` elements of `xs` starting with `i` by the patch `ys`.|
|  `xs.updated(i, x)`      |A copy of `xs` with the element at index `i` replaced by `x`.|
|  `xs(i) = x`	    	    |(or, written out, `xs.update(i, x)`, only available for `mutable.Seq`s). Changes the element of `xs` at index `i` to `x`.|
|  **Sorting:** 	    |						     |
|  `xs.sorted`	            |A new sequence obtained by sorting the elements of `xs` using the standard ordering of the element type of `xs`.|
|  `xs.sortWith(lt)`	    |A new sequence obtained by sorting the elements of `xs` using `lt` as comparison operation.|
|  `xs.sortBy(f)`	    |A new sequence obtained by sorting the elements of `xs`. Comparison between two elements proceeds by mapping the function `f` over both and comparing the results.|
|  **Reversals:** 	    |						     |
|  `xs.reverse`	            |A sequence with the elements of `xs` in reverse order.|

|  `xs.distinctBy(f)`	    |A subsequence of `xs` that contains no duplicated element after applying the transforming function `f`. For instance, `List("foo", "bar", "quux").distinctBy(_.length) == List("foo", "quux")`|

Trait [Seq](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/Seq.html) has two subtraits [LinearSeq](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/LinearSeq.html), and [IndexedSeq](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/IndexedSeq.html). These do not add any new operations to the immutable branch, but each offers different performance characteristics: A linear sequence has efficient `head` and `tail` operations, whereas an indexed sequence has efficient `apply`, `length`, and (if mutable) `update` operations. Frequently used linear sequences are `scala.collection.immutable.List` and `scala.collection.immutable.LazyList`. Frequently used indexed sequences are `scala.Array` and `scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer`. The `Vector` class provides an interesting compromise between indexed and linear access. It has both effectively constant time indexing overhead and constant time linear access overhead. Because of this, vectors are a good foundation for mixed access patterns where both indexed and linear accesses are used. You'll learn more on vectors [later]({% link _overviews/collections-2.13/concrete-immutable-collection-classes.md %}).

On the mutable branch, `IndexedSeq` adds operations for transforming its elements in place (by contrast with
transformation operations such as `map` and `sort`, available on the root `Seq`, which return a new collection
instance).

#### Operations in Class mutable.IndexedSeq ####

| WHAT IT IS                 | WHAT IT DOES|
| ------                     | ------                                                           |
|  **Transformations:**       | |
|  `xs.mapInPlace(f)`        |Transforms all the elements of `xs` by applying the `f` function to each of them.|
|  `xs.sortInPlace()`        |Sorts the collection `xs`.|
|  `xs.sortInPlaceWith(c)`   |Sorts the collection `xs` according to the given comparison function `c`.|
|  `xs.sortInPlaceBy(f)`     |Sorts the collection `xs` according to an ordering defined on the result of the application of the function `f` to each element.|

### Buffers ###

An important sub-category of mutable sequences is `Buffer`s. They allow not only updates of existing elements but also element additions, insertions and removals. The principal new methods supported by a buffer are `append` and `appendAll` for element addition at the end, `prepend` and `prependAll` for addition at the front, `insert` and `insertAll` for element insertions, as well as `remove`, `subtractOne` and `subtractAll` for element removal. These operations are summarized in the following table.

Two often used implementations of buffers are `ListBuffer` and `ArrayBuffer`.  As the name implies, a `ListBuffer` is backed by a `List`, and supports efficient conversion of its elements to a `List`, whereas an `ArrayBuffer` is backed by an array, and can be quickly converted into one.

|  `buf.trimEnd(n)`         |Removes last `n` elements from buffer.|
|  `buf.clear()`           |Removes all elements from buffer.|
|  **Replacement:**        | |
|  `buf.patchInPlace(i, xs, n)`   |Replaces (at most) `n` elements of buffer by elements in `xs`, starting from index `i` in buffer.|
|  **Cloning:**            |                                                                  |
|  `buf.clone()`           |A new buffer with the same elements as `buf`.|
