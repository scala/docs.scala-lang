At the top of the collection hierarchy is trait `Iterable`. All methods in this trait are defined in terms of an abstract method, `iterator`, which yields the collection's elements one by one.

{% tabs trait-iterable_1 %}
{% tab 'Scala 2 and 3' for=trait-iterable_1 %}
```scala
def iterator: Iterator[A]
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Collection classes that implement `Iterable` just need to define this method; all other methods can be inherited from `Iterable`.

`Iterable` also defines many concrete methods, which are all listed in the following table. These methods fall into the following categories:

* **Addition**, `concat`, which appends two collections together, or appends all elements of an iterator to a collection.
* **Map** operations `map`, `flatMap`, and `collect`, which produce a new collection by applying some function to collection elements.
* **Conversions** `to`, `toList`, `toVector`, `toMap`, `toSet`, `toSeq`, `toIndexedSeq`, `toBuffer`, `toArray` which turn an `Iterable` collection into something more specific. If the destination is a mutable collection(`to(collection.mutable.X)`, `toArray`, `toBuffer`), a new collection is created by copying the original elements. All these conversions return their receiver argument unchanged if the run-time type of the collection already matches the demanded collection type. For instance, applying `toList` to a list will yield the list itself.
* **Copying operations**  `copyToArray`. As its name implies, this copies collection elements to an array.
* **Size info** operations `isEmpty`, `nonEmpty`, `size`, `knownSize`, `sizeIs`. The number of elements of a collections can require a traversal in some cases (e.g. `List`). In other cases the collection can have an infinite number of elements (e.g. `LazyList.from(1)`).
* **Element retrieval** operations `head`, `last`, `headOption`, `lastOption`, and `find`. These select the first or last element of a collection, or else the first element matching a condition. Note, however, that not all collections have a well-defined meaning of what "first" and "last" means. For instance, a hash set might store elements according to their hash keys, which might change from run to run. In that case, the "first" element of a hash set could also be different for every run of a program. A collection is _ordered_ if it always yields its elements in the same order. Most collections are ordered, but some (_e.g._ hash sets) are not-- dropping the ordering gives a little bit of extra efficiency. Ordering is often essential to give reproducible tests and to help in debugging. That's why Scala collections give ordered alternatives for all collection types. For instance, the ordered alternative for `HashSet` is `LinkedHashSet`.
* **Sub-collection retrieval operations** `tail`, `init`, `slice`, `take`, `drop`, `takeWhile`, `dropWhile`, `filter`, `filterNot`, `withFilter`. These all return some sub-collection identified by an index range or some predicate.
* **Subdivision operations** `splitAt`, `span`, `partition`, `partitionMap`, `groupBy`, `groupMap`, `groupMapReduce`, which split the elements of this collection into several sub-collections.
* **Element tests** `exists`, `forall`, `count` which test collection elements with a given predicate.
* **Folds** `foldLeft`, `foldRight`, `reduceLeft`, `reduceRight` which apply a binary operation to successive elements.
* **Specific folds** `sum`, `product`, `min`, `max`, which work on collections of specific types (numeric or comparable).
* **String** operations `mkString` and `addString` which give alternative ways of converting a collection to a string.
* **View** operation: A view is a collection that's evaluated lazily. You'll learn more about views in [later]({% link _overviews/collections-2.13/views.md %}).

Two more methods exist in `Iterable` that return iterators: `grouped` and `sliding`. These iterators, however, do not return single elements but whole subsequences of elements of the original collection. The maximal size of these subsequences is given as an argument to these methods. The `grouped` method returns its elements in "chunked" increments, where `sliding` yields a sliding "window" over the elements. The difference between the two should become clear by looking at the following REPL interaction:

{% tabs trait-iterable_2 %}
{% tab 'Scala 2 and 3' for=trait-iterable_2 %}
```
scala> val xs = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
xs: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
scala> val git = xs grouped 3
git: Iterator[List[Int]] = non-empty iterator
scala> git.next()
res3: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3)
scala> git.next()
res4: List[Int] = List(4, 5)
scala> val sit = xs sliding 3
sit: Iterator[List[Int]] = non-empty iterator
scala> sit.next()
res5: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3)
scala> sit.next()
res6: List[Int] = List(2, 3, 4)
scala> sit.next()
res7: List[Int] = List(3, 4, 5)
```

| **Other Iterators:**                      |						     |
| `xs.foreach(f)`	                          |Executes function `f` for every element of `xs`.|
| `xs.grouped(size)`   	                    |An iterator that yields fixed-sized "chunks" of this collection.|

| **Addition:**     	                       |						     |
| `xs.concat(ys)`<br>(or `xs ++ ys`)	       |A collection consisting of the elements of both `xs` and `ys`. `ys` is a [IterableOnce](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/{{ site.scala-version }}/scala/collection/IterableOnce.html) collection, i.e., either an [Iterable](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/{{ site.scala-version }}/scala/collection/Iterable.html) or an [Iterator](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/{{ site.scala-version }}/scala/collection/Iterator.html).|
| **Maps:**     	                           |						     |
| `xs.map(f)`		                             |The collection obtained from applying the function f to every element in `xs`.|
| `xs.flatMap(f)`	                          |The collection obtained from applying the collection-valued function `f` to every element in `xs` and concatenating the results.|

| **Conversions:**                          |						     |
| `xs.to(SortedSet)`                        | Generic conversion operation that takes a collection factory as parameter. |

| `xs.toVector`                             |Converts the collection to a vector.	     |
| `xs.toMap`	    	                          |Converts the collection of key/value pairs to a map. If the collection does not have pairs as elements, calling this operation results in a static type error.|

| **Copying:**                              |						     |
| `xs copyToArray(arr, s, n)`               |Copies at most `n` elements of the collection to array `arr` starting at index `s`. The last two arguments are optional.|

| `xs.size`	    	                           |The number of elements in the collection.	     |
| `xs.knownSize`	    	                      |The number of elements, if this one takes constant time to compute, otherwise `-1`.	     |

| `xs.sizeCompare(n)`	                      |Returns a negative value if `xs` is shorter than `n`, a positive value if it is longer, and `0` if it is of size `n`. Works even if the collection is infinite, for example `LazyList.from(1) sizeCompare 42` returns a positive value.	     |
| `xs.sizeIs < 42`, `xs.sizeIs != 42`, etc. |Provides a more convenient syntax for `xs.sizeCompare(42) < 0`, `xs.sizeCompare(42) != 0`, etc., respectively.|
| **Element Retrieval:**                    |						     |

In the inheritance hierarchy below `Iterable` you find three traits: [Seq](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/{{ site.scala-version }}/scala/collection/Seq.html), [Set](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/{{ site.scala-version }}/scala/collection/Set.html), and [Map](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/{{ site.scala-version }}/scala/collection/Map.html). `Seq` and `Map` implement the [PartialFunction](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/{{ site.scala-version }}/scala/PartialFunction.html) trait with its `apply` and `isDefinedAt` methods, each implemented differently. `Set` gets its `apply` method from [SetOps](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/{{ site.scala-version }}/scala/collection/SetOps.html).

For sequences, `apply` is positional indexing, where elements are always numbered from `0`. That is, `Seq(1, 2, 3)(1)` gives `2`. For sets, `apply` is a membership test. For instance, `Set('a', 'b', 'c')('b')` gives `true` whereas `Set()('a')` gives `false`. Finally, for maps, `apply` is a selection. For instance, `Map('a' -> 1, 'b' -> 10, 'c' -> 100)('b')` gives `10`.

In the following, we will explain each of the three kinds of collections in more detail.
