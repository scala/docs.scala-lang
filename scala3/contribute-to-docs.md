## Overview
There are several ongoing efforts to produce high quality documentation for
Scala 3. In particular there are the following documents:

- Scala 3 book
- Macros tutorial
- Migration guide
- Scala 3 language reference

We welcome contributions from the community to every aspect of the documentation.


### How can I contribute?
In general, there is many different ways you could help us:

- **Confused about something in any of the docs?** Open an issue.
- **Found something not up-to-date?** Open an issue or create a PR.
- **Typos and other small text enhancements?** Create a PR.
- **Want to add something new or make larger changes?** Great! Please open an issue and let us discuss this.

Typically, each of the different documentation projects contain links (and so does this document, in the table-of-contents pane) to edit and improve them. Additionally, below we provide you with the necessary information to get started.

## Scala 3 Book
The [Scala 3 Book][scala3-book] is being written by Alvin Alexander and provides an overview over all the important features of Scala 3. It targets readers, which are new to Scala.
