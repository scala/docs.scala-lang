If you create a Scala 3 source code file named _Hello.scala_:

```scala
@main def hello = println("Hello, world")
```

and then compile that file with `scalac`:

```bash
$ scalac Hello.scala
```

you’ll notice that amongst other resulting files, `scalac` creates files with the _.tasty_ extension:

```bash
$ ls -1
Hello$package$.class
Hello$package.class
Hello$package.tasty
Hello.scala
hello.class
hello.tasty
```

This leads to the natural question, “What is tasty?”



## What is TASTy?

TASTy is an acronym that comes from the term, _Typed Abstract Syntax Trees_.
It’s a high-level interchange format for Scala 3, and in this document we’ll refer to it as _Tasty_.

A first important thing to know is that Tasty files are generated by the `scalac` compiler, and contain _all_ the information about your source code, including the syntactic structure of your program, and _complete_ information about types, positions, and even documentation. Tasty files contain much more information than _.class_ files, which are generated to run on the JVM. (More on this shortly.)

In Scala 3, the compilation process looks like this:

```text
         +-------------+    +-------------+    +-------------+
$ scalac | Hello.scala | -> | Hello.tasty | -> | Hello.class |
         +-------------+    +-------------+    +-------------+
                ^                  ^                  ^
                |                  |                  |
           Your source        TASTy file         Class file
               code           for scalac        for the JVM
                              (contains         (incomplete
                               complete         information)
                             information)
```

You can view the contents of a _.tasty_ file in a human-readable form by running the compiler on it with the `-print-tasty` flag.
You can also view the contents decompiled in a form similar to Scala source code using the `-decompile` flag.
```bash
$ scalac -print-tasty hello.tasty
$ scalac -decompile hello.tasty
```

### The issue with _.class_ files

Because of issues such as [type erasure][erasure], _.class_ files are actually an incomplete representation of your code.
A simple way to demonstrate this is with a `List` example.

_Type erasure_ means that when you write Scala code like this that’s supposed to run on the JVM:

```scala
val xs: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3)
```

that code is compiled to a _.class_ file that needs to be compatible with the JVM. As a result of that compatibility requirement, the code inside that class file --- which you can see with a `javap` command --- ends up looking like this:

```java
public scala.collection.immutable.List<java.lang.Object> xs();
```

That `javap` command output shows a Java representation of what’s contained in the class file. Notice in this output that `xs` _is not_ defined as a `List[Int]` anymore; it’s essentially represented as a `List[java.lang.Object]`. For your Scala code to work with the JVM, the `Int` type has been erased.

Later, when you access an element of your `List[Int]` in your Scala code, like this:

```scala
val x = xs(0)
```

the resulting class file will have a casting operation for this line of code, which you can think of being like this:

```
int x = (Int) xs.get(0)               // Java-ish
val x = xs.get(0).asInstanceOf[Int]   // more Scala-like
```

Again, this is done for compatibility, so your Scala code can run on the JVM. However, the information that we already had a list of integers is lost in the class files.
This poses problems when trying to compile a Scala program against an already compiled library. For this, we need more information than usually available in class files.

And this discussion only covers the topic of type erasure. There are similar issues for every other Scala construct that the JVM isn’t aware of, including constructs like unions, intersections, traits with parameters, and many more Scala 3 features.

### TASTy to the Rescue
So, instead of having no information about the original types in _.class_ files, or only the public API (as with the Scala 2.13 “Pickle” format), the TASTy format stores the complete abstract syntax tree (AST), after type checking. Storing the whole AST has a lot of advantages: it enables separate compilation, recompilation for a different JVM version, static analysis of programs, and many more.

### Key points

So that’s the first takeaway from this section: The types you specify in your Scala code aren’t represented completely accurately in _.class_ files.

A second key point is to understand that there are differences between the information that’s available at _compile time_ and _run time_:

- At **compile time**, as `scalac` reads and analyzes your code, it knows that `xs` is a `List[Int]`
- When the compiler writes your code to a class file, it writes that `xs` is a `List[Object]`, and it adds casting information everywhere else `xs` is accessed
- Then at **run time** --- with your code running inside the JVM --- the JVM doesn’t know that your list is a `List[Int]`

With Scala 3 and Tasty, here’s another important note about compile time:

- When you write Scala 3 code that uses other Scala 3 libraries, `scalac` doesn’t have to read their _.class_ files anymore; it can read their _.tasty_ files, which, as mentioned, are an _exact_ representation of your code. This is important to enable separate compilation and compatibility between Scala 2.13 and Scala 3.



## Tasty benefits

As you can imagine, having a complete representation of your code has [many benefits][benefits]:

- The compiler uses it to support separate compilation.
- The Scala _Language Server Protocol_-based language server uses it to support hyperlinking, command completion, documentation, and also for global operations such as find-references and renaming.
- Tasty makes an excellent foundation for a new generation of [reflection-based macros][macros].
- Optimizers and analyzers can use it for deep code analysis and advanced code generation.

In a related note, Scala 2.13.6 has a TASTy reader, and the Scala 3 compiler can also read the 2.13 “Pickle” format. The [Classpath Compatibility Page][compatibility-ref] in the Scala 3 Migration Guide explains the benefits of this cross-compiling capability.



## More information

In summary, Tasty is a high-level interchange format for Scala 3, and _.tasty_ files contain a complete representation of your source code, leading to the benefits outlined in the previous section.
