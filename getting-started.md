The following tutorials will walk you through the set up process for either way
you prefer.

However, if you just want to jump directly into Scala without installing anything, skip the guides on this page and check out:

## Setting up and getting started with Scala

### If prefer working in an IDE...

IntelliJ is the most commonly-used IDE by Scala developers. In this tutorial,
we'll walk you through downloading and setting up IntelliJ with the Scala
plugin, and we'll get you started with your first Scala project, complete with
unit tests!

* [Getting Started with Scala in IntelliJ](getting-started-intellij-track/getting-started-with-scala-in-intellij.html)
* [Building a Scala Project with IntelliJ and sbt](getting-started-intellij-track/building-a-scala-project-with-intellij-and-sbt.html)
* [Testing Scala in IntelliJ with ScalaTest](getting-started-intellij-track/testing-scala-in-intellij-with-scalatest.html)


### If you prefer working on the command line...

If you prefer using a text editor like emacs, Vim, Atom, or Sublime Text, then
the best way to compile, test, and run Scala code is using _sbt_, Scala's build
tool.

* [Getting Started with Scala and sbt on the Command Line](getting-started-sbt-track/getting-started-with-scala-and-sbt-on-the-command-line.html)
* [Testing Scala with sbt and ScalaTest on the Command Line](getting-started-sbt-track/testing-scala-with-sbt-on-the-command-line.html)

<!-- sbt is the easiest way to ensure that your Scala project is reproducible;
you specify a Scala version, any libraries you depend on, and sbt takes care of
the rest, so it's as easy as possible for someone else to compile and run your
Scala project. -->
