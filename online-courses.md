The online courses from the [Scala Center] provide two main paths to learn 
Scala. The fast path consists of taking the course [Effective Programming 
in Scala],
otherwise you can take the full [Scala Specialization], which is made of
four courses and a capstone project.

All the courses are available for free. Optionally, a subscription gives
you access to a certificate of completion that attests your accomplishments.

[Coursera certificates](https://learners.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209819053-Get-a-Course-Certificate) or

Your subscriptions also supports the work of the [Scala Center], whose mission
is to create high-quality educational material.

You can learn more about the Scala Center online courses in the following video:

## Scala Learning Path

The diagram below summarizes the possible learning paths with our courses:

![](/resources/images/learning-path.png)

The “foundational” courses target programmers with no prior experience in Scala, whereas the “deepening”
courses aim at strengthening Scala programmers skills in a specific domain (such as parallel programming).

We recommend starting with either Effective Programming in Scala, or Functional Programming Principles in
Scala followed by Functional Program Design. Then, you can complement your Scala skills by taking any
of the courses Programming Reactive Systems, Parallel Programming, or Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark.
In case you take the Scala Specialization, you will end with the Scala Capstone Project.

## Effective Programming in Scala

[Effective Programming in Scala] teaches non-Scala programmers everything
they need to be ready to work in Scala. At the end of this hands-on course,
you will know how to achieve common programming tasks in Scala (e.g.,
modeling business domains, implementing business logic, designing large
systems made of components, handling errors, manipulating data, running
concurrent tasks in parallel, testing your code). You can learn more about
this course in the following video:

This course is also a good way to upgrade your Scala 2 knowledge to Scala 3.

After taking this course, you might be interested in improving your
skills in specific areas by taking the courses [Parallel Programming],
[Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark], or [Programming Reactive Systems].

## Scala Specialization

The [Scala Specialization] provides a hands-on introduction to functional programming using Scala. You can access the courses
material and exercises by either signing up for the specialization or auditing the courses individually. The
specialization has the following courses.
* [Functional Programming Principles in Scala],
* [Functional Program Design in Scala],
* [Parallel programming],
* [Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark],
* [Functional Programming in Scala Capstone].

These courses provide a deep understanding of the Scala language itself,
and they also dive into more specific topics such as parallel programming,
and Spark.

## Programming Reactive Systems

[Programming Reactive Systems] (also available on [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/scala-akka-reactive))
teaches how to write responsive, scalable, and resilient systems with the
library Akka.

## Scala 2 Courses

The above courses use Scala 3 (except the Spark courses). If needed, you can find
the (legacy) Scala 2 version of our courses here:
