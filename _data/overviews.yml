        String Interpolation allows users to embed variable references directly in processed string literals. Here’s an example:
          <pre><code>val name = "James"
          println(s"Hello, $name")  // Hello, James</code></pre>
        In the above, the literal <code>s"Hello, $name"</code> is a processed string literal. This means that the compiler does some additional work to this literal. A processed string literal is denoted by a set of characters preceding the ". String interpolation was introduced by SIP-11, which contains all details of the implementation.

Composing concurrent tasks in this way tends to result in faster, asynchronous, non-blocking parallel code."

      description: "When two versions of Scala are binary compatible, it is safe to compile your project on one Scala version and link against another Scala version at run time. Safe run-time linkage (only!) means that the JVM does not throw a (subclass of) LinkageError when executing your program in the mixed scenario, assuming that none arise when compiling and running on the same version of Scala. Concretely, this means you may have external dependencies on your run-time classpath that use a different version of Scala than the one you’re compiling with, as long as they’re binary compatible. In other words, separate compilation on different binary compatible versions does not introduce problems compared to compiling and running everything on the same version of Scala."
