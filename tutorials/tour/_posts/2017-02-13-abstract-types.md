Traits and abstract classes can have an abstract type member. This means that the concrete implementations define the actual type. Here's an example:

```tut
trait Buffer {
  type T
  val element: T
}
```
Here we have defined an abstract `type T`. It is used to describe the type of `element`. We can extend this trait in an abstract class, adding an upper-type-bound to `T` to make it more specific.

```tut
abstract class SeqBuffer extends Buffer {
  type U
  type T <: Seq[U]
  def length = element.length
}
```
Notice how we can use yet another abstract `type U` as an upper-type-bound. This `class SeqBuffer` allows us to store only sequences in the buffer by stating that type `T` has to be a subtype of `Seq[U]` for a new abstract type `U`.

Traits or [classes](classes.html) with abstract type members are often used in combination with anonymous class instantiations. To illustrate this, we now look at a program which deals with a sequence buffer that refers to a list of integers:

```tut
abstract class IntSeqBuffer extends SeqBuffer {
  type U = Int
}


def newIntSeqBuf(elem1: Int, elem2: Int): IntSeqBuffer =
  new IntSeqBuffer {
       type T = List[U]
       val element = List(elem1, elem2)
     }
val buf = newIntSeqBuf(7, 8)
println("length = " + buf.length)
println("content = " + buf.element)
```
Here the factory `newIntSeqBuf` uses an anonymous class implementation of `IntSeqBuf` (i.e. `new IntSeqBuffer`), setting `type T` to a `List[Int]`.

It is also possible to turn abstract type members into type parameters of classes and vice versa. Here is a version of the code above which only uses type parameters:

```tut
abstract class Buffer[+T] {
  val element: T
}
abstract class SeqBuffer[U, +T <: Seq[U]] extends Buffer[T] {
  def length = element.length
}

def newIntSeqBuf(e1: Int, e2: Int): SeqBuffer[Int, Seq[Int]] =
  new SeqBuffer[Int, List[Int]] {
    val element = List(e1, e2)
  }

val buf = newIntSeqBuf(7, 8)
println("length = " + buf.length)
println("content = " + buf.element)
```

Note that we have to use [variance annotations](variances.html) here (`+T <: Seq[U]`) in order to hide the concrete sequence implementation type of the object returned from method `newIntSeqBuf`.  Furthermore, there are cases where it is not possible to replace abstract types with type parameters.
