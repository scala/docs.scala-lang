Mixins are traits which are used to compose a class.

```tut
abstract class A {
  val message: String
}
class B extends A {
  val message = "I'm an instance of class B"
}
trait C extends A {
  def loudMessage = message.toUpperCase()
}
class D extends B with C

val d = new D
d.message  // I'm an instance of class B
d.loudMessage  // I'M AN INSTANCE OF CLASS B
```
Class `D` has a superclass `B` and a mixin `C`. Classes can only have one superclass but many mixins (using the keywords `extends` and `with` respectively). The mixins and the superclass may have the same supertype.

Now let's look at a more interesting example starting with an abstract class:

```tut
abstract class AbsIterator {
  type T
  def hasNext: Boolean
  def next: T
}
```
The class has an abstract type `T` and the standard iterator methods.

Next, we'll implement a concrete class (all abstract members `T`, `hasNext`, and `next` have implementations):

```tut
class StringIterator(s: String) extends AbsIterator {
  type T = Char
  private var i = 0
  def hasNext = i < s.length
  def next = {
    val ch = s charAt i
    i += 1
    ch
  }
}
```
`StringIterator` takes a `String` and can be used to iterate over the String (e.g. to see if a String contains a certain character).

Now let's create a trait which also extends `AbsIterator`.

```tut
trait RichIterator extends AbsIterator {
  def foreach(f: T => Unit): Unit = while (hasNext) f(next)
}
```
Because `RichIterator` is a trait, it doesn't need to implement the abstract members of AbsIterator.

We would like to combine the functionality of `StringIterator` and `RichIterator` into a single class.

```tut
object StringIteratorTest extends App {
  class RichStringIter extends StringIterator(args(0)) with RichIterator
  val iter = new RichStringIter
  iter foreach println
}
```
The new class `RichStringIter` has `StringIterator` as a superclass and `RichIterator` as a mixin.

With single inheritance we would not be able to achieve this level of flexibility.
