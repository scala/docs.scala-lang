Let's divide the operators, for the purpose of teaching, into **four categories**:

* Keywords/reserved symbols
* Automatically imported methods
* Common methods
* Syntactic sugars/composition

And let's see some arbitrary examples:

    ->    // Automatically imported method
    <-    // Keyword
    ||=   // Syntactic sugar
    ++=   // Syntactic sugar/composition or common method
    <=    // Common method
    _+_   // Keyword/composition
    ::    // Common method or object
    :+=   // Common method

The exact meaning of most of these methods depend on the class that is defining
them. For example, `<=` on `Int` means _"less than or equal to"_, but it might
mean something else in another class.  `::` is probably the method defined on
`List` but it _could_ also be the object of the same name.

So, let's see them.

Keywords/reserved symbols
-------------------------

There are some symbols in Scala that are special. Two of them are considered
proper keywords, while others are just "reserved". They are:

    // Keywords
    <-  // Used on for-comprehensions, to separate pattern from generator
    =>  // Used for function types, function literals and import renaming

    // Reserved
    ( )        // Delimit expressions and parameters
    [ ]        // Delimit type parameters
    { }        // Delimit blocks
    .          // Method call and path separator
    // /* */   // Comments
    #          // Used in type notations
    :          // Type ascription or context bounds
    <: >: <%   // Upper, lower and view bounds
    " """      // Strings
    '          // Indicate symbols and characters
    @          // Annotations and variable binding on pattern matching
    `          // Denote constant or enable arbitrary identifiers
    ,          // Parameter separator
    ;          // Statement separator
    _*         // vararg expansion
    _          // Many different meanings

These are all _part of the language_, and, as such, can be found in any text
that properly describe the language, such as [Scala Specification][1](PDF)
itself.

The last one, the underscore, deserve a special description, because it is so
widely used, and has so many different meanings. Here's a sample:

    import scala._    // Wild card -- all of Scala is imported
    import scala.{ Predef => _, _ } // Exception, everything except Predef
    def f[M[_]]       // Higher kinded type parameter
    def f(m: M[_])    // Existential type
    _ + _             // Anonymous function placeholder parameter
    m _               // Eta expansion of method into method value
    m(_)              // Partial function application
    _ => 5            // Discarded parameter
    case _ =>         // Wild card pattern -- matches anything
    f(xs: _*)         // Sequence xs is passed as multiple parameters to f(ys: T*)
    case Seq(xs @ _*) // Identifier xs is bound to the whole matched sequence

I probably forgot some other meaning, though.

Automatically imported methods
------------------------------

So, if you did not find the symbol you are looking for in the list above, then
it must be a method, or part of one. But, often, you'll see some symbol and the
documentation for the class will not have that method. When this happens,
either you are looking at a composition of one or more methods with something
else, or the method has been imported into scope, or is available through an
imported implicit conversion.

These _can still be found_ on [ScalaDoc][2]: you just have to know where to
look for them. Or, failing that, look at the [index][3] (presently broken on
2.9.1, but available on nightly).

Every Scala code has three automatic imports:

    // Not necessarily in this order
    import _root_.java.lang._      // _root_ denotes an absolute path
    import _root_.scala._
    import _root_.scala.Predef._

The first two only make classes and singleton objects available. The third one
contains all implicit conversions and imported methods, since [`Predef`][4] is
an object itself.

Looking inside `Predef` quickly show some symbols:

    class <:<
    class =:=
    object <%<
    object =:=

Any other symbol will be made available through an _implicit conversion_. Just
look at the methods tagged with `implicit` that receive, as parameter, an
object of type that is receiving the method. For example:

    "a" -> 1  // Look for an implicit from String, AnyRef, Any or type parameter

In the above case, `->` is defined in the class [`ArrowAssoc`][5] through the
method `any2ArrowAssoc` that takes an object of type `A`, where `A` is an
unbounded type parameter to the same method.

Common methods
--------------

So, many symbols are simply methods on a class. For instance, if you do

    List(1, 2) ++ List(3, 4)

You'll find the method `++` right on the ScalaDoc for [List][6]. However,
there's one convention that you must be aware when searching for methods.
Methods ending in colon (`:`) bind _to the right_ instead of the left. In other
words, while the above method call is equivalent to:

    List(1, 2).++(List(3, 4))

If I had, instead `1 :: List(2, 3)`, that would be equivalent to:

    List(2, 3).::(1)

So you need to look at the type found _on the right_ when looking for methods
ending in colon. Consider, for instance:

    1 +: List(2, 3) :+ 4

The first method (`+:`) binds to the right, and is found on `List`. The second
method (`:+`) is just a normal method, and binds to the left -- again, on
`List`.

Syntactic sugars/composition
-----------------------------

So, here's a few syntactic sugars that may hide a method:

    class Example(arr: Array[Int] = Array.fill(5)(0)) {
      def apply(n: Int) = arr(n)
      def update(n: Int, v: Int) = arr(n) = v
      def a = arr(0); def a_=(v: Int) = arr(0) = v
      def b = arr(1); def b_=(v: Int) = arr(1) = v
      def c = arr(2); def c_=(v: Int) = arr(2) = v
      def d = arr(3); def d_=(v: Int) = arr(3) = v
      def e = arr(4); def e_=(v: Int) = arr(4) = v
      def +(v: Int) = new Example(arr map (_ + v))
      def unapply(n: Int) = if (arr.indices contains n) Some(arr(n)) else None
    }

    var ex = new Example
    println(ex(0))  // calls apply(0)
    ex(0) = 2       // calls update(0, 2)
    ex.b = 3        // calls b_=(3)
    val ex(c) = 2   // calls unapply(2) and assigns result to c
    ex += 1         // substituted for ex = ex + 1

The last one is interesting, because *any* symbolic method can be combined to
form an assignment-like method that way.

And, of course, there's various combinations that can appear in code:

    (_+_) // An expression, or parameter, that is an anonymous function with
          // two parameters, used exactly where the underscores appear, and
          // which calls the "+" method on the first parameter passing the
          // second parameter as argument.
