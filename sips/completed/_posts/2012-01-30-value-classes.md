title: SIP-15 - Value Classes

vote-status: accepted
vote-text: This SIP has already been accepted. There has been concern for numerical computing.  We think future SIP(s), using work from SIP-15, can provide more benefit to numerical computing users. The SIP as it exists benefits all users of implicit enrichment classes, and takes us much further to unboxed high performance code. This SIP does not exclude further work towards improving numerical computing in Scala.

## History

| Date          | Version       |
|---------------|---------------|
| Jan 30th 2012 | Original inline classes proposal |
| Feb 7th 2012 | Changed inline classes to value classes, added Josh Suereth as author. |

## Introduction

This is a proposal to introduce syntax for classes in Scala that can get
completely inlined, so operations on these classes have zero overhead compared
to external methods. Some use cases for inlined classes are:

* *Inlined implicit wrappers*. Methods on those wrappers would be translated to
  extensions methods.
* *New numeric classes*, such as unsigned ints. There would no longer need to be
  a boxing overhead for such classes. So this is similar to value types in .NET.
* Classes representing *units of measure*. Again, no boxing overhead would be
  incurred for these classes.

The proposal is currently in an early stage. It’s not yet been implemented, and
the proposed implementation strategy is too complicated to be able to predict
with certainty that it will work as specified. Consequently, details of the
proposal might change driven by implementation concerns.

## Value Classes

The gist of the proposal is to allow user-defined classes to extend from AnyVal
in situations like this:

    class C (val u: U) extends AnyVal {
      def m1(ps1) = ...
      ...
      def mN(psN) = ...
    }

Such classes are called *value classes*. A value class `C` must satisfy the
following criteria:

1. `C` must have exactly one parameter, which is marked with `val` and which has
   public accessibility. The type of that parameter (e.g. `U` above) is called
   the *underlying type* of `C`
2. `C` may not have `@specialized` type parameters.
3. The underlying type of `C` may not be a value class.
4. `C` may not have secondary constructors.
5. `C` may not define concrete `equals` or `hashCode` methods.
6. `C` must be either a toplevel class or a member of a statically accessible
   object.
7. `C` must be ephemeral.

A class or trait `C` is *ephemeral* if the following holds:

1. `C` may not declare fields (other than the parameter of a value class).
2. `C` may not contain object definitions.
3. `C` may not have initialization statements.

We say that a value class `C` *unboxes directly* to a class `D` if the
underlying type of `C` is a type-instance of `D`. Indirect unboxing is the
transitive closure of direct unboxing. A value class may not unbox directly or
indirectly to itself.

The following implicit assumptions apply to value classes.

1. Value classes are implicitly treated as final, so they cannot be extended by
   other classes.
2. Value classes are implicitly assumed to have structural equality and hash codes. I.e.
   their `equals` and `hashCode` methods are taken to be defined as follows:

        def equals(other: Any) = other match {
          case that: C => this.u == that.u
          case _ => false
        }
        def hashCode = u.hashCode

## Universal traits

Scala's rule for inheritance do not permit value classes to extend traits that
extend from `AnyRef`. To permit value classes to extend traits, we introduce
*universal traits*, which extend from `Any`. A universal trait `T` needs to
explicitly extend class `Any`. In the example below, `Equals` is a universal
trait with superclass `Any`, but `Ordered`'s superclass is still assumed to be
`AnyRef`.

    trait Equals[T] extends Any { ... }
    trait Ordered[T] extends Equal[T] { ... }

To turn `Ordered` into a universal trait, add an explicit superclass `Any`:

    trait Ordered[T] extends Any with Equal[T] { ... }

Like value classes, universal traits need to be ephemeral.

## Expansion of value classes.

Value classes are expanded as follows. For concreteness, we assume a value class
`Meter` that is defined like this:

    class Meter(val underlying: Double) extends AnyVal with Printable {
       def plus (other: Meter): Meter =
          new Meter(this.underlying + other.underlying)
       def divide (factor: Double): Meter = new Meter(this.underlying / factor)
       def less (other: Meter): Boolean = this.underlying < other.underlying
       override def toString: String = underlying.toString + “m”
    }

For simplicity we assume that all expansion steps are done on erased types.

### Step 1: Extracting methods.

Let the *extractable methods* of a value class be all methods that are directly
declared in the class (as opposed to being inherited) and that do not contain a
super call in their body. For each extractable method `m`, we create another
method named `extension$m` in the companion object of that class (if no
companion object exists, a fresh one is *created*). The `extension$m` method
takes an additional parameter in first position which is named `$this` and has
the value class as type. Generally, in a value class

    class C(val u: U) extends AnyVal

a method

    def m(params): R = body

is expanded to the following method in the companion object of class `C`:

    def extension$m($this: C, params): R = body2

Here `body2` is the same as `body` with each occurence of `this` or `C.this`
replaced by `$this`. The original method `m` in `C` will be changed to

    def m(params): R = C.extension$m(this, params)

Overloaded methods may be augmented with an additional integer to distinguish
them after types are erased (see the transformations of the `divide` method in
the following steps).

Also in this step, synthetic `hashCode` and `equals` methods are added to the
class.

In our example, the `Meter` class would be expanded as follows:

    class Meter(val underlying: Double) extends AnyVal with Printable {
        def plus (other: Meter): Meter =
           Meter.extension$plus(this, other)
        def divide (other: Meter): Double =
           Meter.extension1$divide(this, other)
        def divide (factor: Double): Meter =
           Meter.extension2$divide(this, factor)
        def less (other: Meter): Boolean =
           Meter.extension$less(this, other)
        override def toString: String =
           Meter.extension$toString(this)
        override def equals(other: Any) =
           Meter.extension$equals(this)
        override def hashCode =
           Meter.extension$hashCode(this)
    }
    object Meter {
       def extension$plus($this: Meter, other: Meter) =
         new Meter($this.underlying + other.underlying)
       def extension1$divide($this: Meter, other: Meter): Double =
         $this.underlying / other.underlying
       def extension2$divide($this: Meter, factor: Double): Meter =
         new Meter($this.underlying / factor)
       def extension$less($this: Meter, other: Meter): Boolean =
          $this.underlying < other.underlying
       def extension$toString($this: Meter): String =
          $this.underlying.toString + “m”
       def extension$equals($this: Meter, other: Any) = other match {
          case that: Meter => $this.underlying == that.underlying
          case _ => false
       }
       def extension$hashCode($this: Meter) = $this.underlying
    }

### Step 2: Rerouting calls

In this step any call to a method that got extracted in step 1 into a companion
object gets redirected to the newly created method in that companion object.
Generally, a call

    p.m(args)

where `m` is an extractable method declared in a value class `C` gets rewritten to
 
    C.extension$m(p, args)

For instance the two calls in the following code fragment

    val x, y: Meter
    x.plus(y)
    x.toString

would be rewritten to

    Meter.extension$plus(x, y)
    Meter.extension$toString(x)

### Step 3: Erasure

Next, we introduce for each value class `C` a new type `C$unboxed` (this type
will be eliminated again in step 4). The newly generated type is assumed to have
no members and to be completely outside the normal Scala class hierarchy. That
is, it is a subtype of no other type and is a supertype only of `scala.Nothing`.

We now replace every occurence of the type `C` in a symbol's type or in a tree's
type annotation by `C$unboxed`. There are however the following two exceptions
to this rule:

1. Type tests are left unaffected. So, in the type test below, `C` is left as it
   is.

        e.isInstanceOf[C]

2. All occurences of methods in class `C` are left unaffected.

We then re-typecheck the program, performing the following adaptations if types
do not match up.

1. If `e` is an expression of type `C$unboxed`, and the expected type is some other
   type `T`, `e` is converted to type `C` using

        new C(e.asInstanceOf[U])

   where `U` is the underlying type of `C`. After that, further adaptations may
   be effected on `C`, employing the usual rules of erasure typing. Similarly,
   if a selection is performed on an expression of type `C$unboxed`, the
   expression is first converted to type `C` using the conversion above.
2. If the expected type of an expression `e` of type `T` is `C$unboxed`, then
   `e` is first adapted with expected type `C` giving `e2`, and `e2` then is
   converted to `C$unboxed` using

        e2.u.asInstanceOf[C$unboxed]

   where `u` is the name of the value parameter of `C`. Similarly, if an
   expression `e` is explicitly converted using

        e.asInstanceOf[C$unboxed]

   then `e` is first converted to type `C`, giving `e2`, and the cast is then
   replaced by

        e2.u.asInstanceOf[C$unboxed]

3. The rules for conversions from and to arrays over value classes are analogous
   to the rules for arrays over primitive value classes.


Value classes are rewritten at this stage to normal reference classes. That is,
their parent changes from `AnyVal` to `java.lang.Object`. The `AnyVal` type
itself is also rewritten during erasure to `java.lang.Object`, so the change
breaks no subtype relationships.

We finally perform the following peephole optimizations:

    new C(e).u               ==> e
    new C(e).isInstanceOf[C] ==> true
    new C(e) == new C(f)     ==> e == f
    new C(e) != new C(f)     ==> e != f

### Step 4: Cleanup

In the last step, all occurrences of type `C$unboxed` are replaced by the
underlying type of `C`. Any redundant casts of the form

    e.asInstanceOf[T]

where `e` is already of type `T` are removed and replaced by `e`.

## Examples

### Example 1

The program statements on the left are converted using steps 1 to 3 to the
statements on the right.

    var m, n: Meter           var m, n: Meter$unboxed
    var o: AnyRef             var o: AnyRef
    m = n                     m = n
    o = m                     o = new Meter(m.asInstanceOf[Double])
    m.print                   new Meter(m.asInstanceOf[Double]).print
    m less n                  Meter.extension$less(m, n)
    m.toString                Meter.extension$toString(m)
    m.isInstanceOf[Ordered]   new Meter(m.asInstanceOf[Double]).isInstanceOf[Ordered]
    m.asInstanceOf[Ordered]   new Meter(m.asInstanceOf[Double]).asInstanceOf[Ordered]
    o.isInstanceOf[Meter]     o.isInstanceOf[Meter]
    o.asInstanceOf[Meter]     o.asInstanceOf[Meter].underlying.asInstanceOf[Meter$unboxed]
    m.isInstanceOf[Meter]     new Meter(m.asInstanceOf[Double]).isInstanceOf[Meter]
    m.asInstanceOf[Meter]     m.asInstanceOf[Meter$unboxed]

Including the cleanup step 4 the same program statements are converted as
follows.

    var m, n: Meter           var m, n: Double
    var o: Any                var o: Any
    m = n                     m = n
    o = m                     o = new Meter(m)
    m.print                   new Meter(m).print
    m less n                  Meter.extension$less(m, n)
    m.toString                Meter.extension$toString(m)
    m.isInstanceOf[Ordered]   new Meter(m).isInstanceOf[Ordered]
    m.asInstanceOf[Ordered]   new Meter(m).asInstanceOf[Ordered]
    o.isInstanceOf[Meter]     o.isInstanceOf[Meter]
    o.asInstanceOf[Meter]     o.asInstanceOf[Meter].underlying
    m.isInstanceOf[Meter]     new Meter(m).isInstanceOf[Meter]
    m.asInstanceOf[Meter]     m.asInstanceOf[Double]

### Example 2

After all 4 steps the `Meter` class is translated to the following code.

    class Meter(val underlying: Double) extends AnyVal with Printable {
       def plus (other: Meter): Meter = 
         new Meter(Meter.extension$plus(this.underlying, other.underlying))
       def divide (other: Meter): Double = 
         Meter.extension1$divide(this.underlying, other)
       def divide (factor: Double): Meter = 
         new Meter(Meter.extension2$divide(this.underlying, factor))
       def less (other: Meter): Boolean = 
         Meter.extension$less(this.underlying, other)
       override def toString: String = 
         Meter.extension$toString(this.underlying)
       override def equals(other: Any) = 
         Meter.extension$equals(this)
       override def hashCode = 
         Meter.extension$hashCode(this)
    }
    object Meter {
      def extension$plus($this: Double, other: Double) = 
        $this + other
      def extension1$divide($this: Double, other: Double): Double = 
        $this / other
      def extension2$divide($this: Double, factor: Double): Double = 
        $this / factor)
      def extension$less($this: Double, other: Double): Boolean =
        $this < other
      def extension$toString($this: Double): String = 
        $this.toString + “m”
      def extension$equals($this: Double, other: Object) = other match {
        case that: Meter => $this == that.underlying
        case _ => false
      }
      def extension$hashCode($this: Double) = $this.hashCode
    }

Note that the two `divide` methods end up with the same type in object `Meter`.
(The fact that they also have the same body is accidental). That’s why we needed
to distinguish them by adding an integer number.

The same situation can arise in other circumstances as well: Two overloaded
methods might end up with the same type after erasure. In the general case,
Scala would treat this situation as an error, as it would for other types that
get erased. So we propose to solve only the specific problem that multiple
overloaded methods in a value class itself might clash after erasure.

## Further Optimizations?

The proposal foresees that only methods defined directly in a value class get
expanded in the companion object; methods inherited from universal traits are
unaffected. For instance, in the example above

    m.print

would translate to

    new Meter(m).print

We might at some point want to investigate ways how inherited trait methods can
also be inlined. For the moment this is outside the scope of the proposal.
