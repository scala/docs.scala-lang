title: SIP-11 - String Interpolation

vote-status: accepted
vote-text: This SIP has already been accepted. We expect a SIP for 2.11 that will allow the desugared form of interpolated strings in the pattern matcher to become valid syntax. This SIP only allows the sugared interpolated strings to work.
