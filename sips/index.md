# Welcome #

This is the landing page for the Scala Improvement Process (SIP). The
Scala Library Improvement Process (SLIP) has its own distinct mechanism
documented at [Scala SLIP github project page](https://www.github.com/scala/slip).
In time, the SIP mechanism may be split out into a github oriented process 
similar to the SLIP mechanism.

The SIP process replaced the older SID (Scala Improvement Document) process,
however the old completed SID documents are still available to review in the
[completed section of the SIP list](sip-list.html).

## SLIPs

For changes and additions to the Scala core libraries (i.e. those distributed
with the main scala-lang download), a still rigorous (yet less demanding) process
called the Scala Library Improvement Process (SLIP) exists.

SLIPs are intended for any library addition or modification that does not require
associated changes to the Scala language or compiler.

[Submitting a SLIP](./slip-submission.html) covers the process.

## SIPs

A **SIP** (_Scala Improvement Process_) is a process for submitting changes to
the Scala language. Its main motivation is to become the primary mechanism to
propose, discuss and implement language changes. In this process, all changes to
the language go through design documents, called Scala Improvement Proposals
(SIPs), which are openly discussed by a committee and only upon reaching a
consensus are accepted to be merged into the Scala compiler.

The aim of the Scala Improvement Process is to apply the openness and
collaboration that have shaped Scala's documentation and implementation to the
process of evolving the language. SIPs are for changes to the Scala
language and/or compiler and are subject to a
[rigorous review process](./sip-submission.html) and are usually accompanied by
changes to the [Scala language specification](http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/),
lots of review and discussion on
the [scala-internals](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scala-internals) mailing list
and voting/approval milestones. Please read
[Submitting a SIP](./sip-submission.html) and our [SIP tutorial](./sip-tutorial.html) for
more information.
