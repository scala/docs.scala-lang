## How do I get started? ##

Before proposing a new SLIP or new library functionality, it's a good idea
to get a feel for the core libraries first, and there's no better way than
by helping fix some of the 
[core library issues in community tickets](http://scala-lang.org/contribute/#community_tickets).

## How do I submit? ##

Follow the instructions on the 
[Scala SLIP github project page](https://www.github.com/scala/slip)
