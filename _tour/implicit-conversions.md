Implicit conversions are a powerful Scala feature that enable two common use cases:
- allow users to supply an argument of one type, as if it were another type, to avoid boilerplate.
- in Scala 2, to provide additional members to closed classes (replaced by [extension methods][exts] in Scala 3).

### Detailed Explanation
{% tabs implicit-conversion-defn class=tabs-scala-version %}
{% tab 'Scala 2' %}
In Scala 2, an implicit conversion from type `S` to type `T` is defined by either an [implicit class]({% link _overviews/core/implicit-classes.md %}) `T` that has a single parameter of type `S`, an [implicit value]({% link _tour/implicit-parameters.md %}) which has function type `S => T`, or by an implicit method convertible to a value of that type.
{% endtab %}
{% tab 'Scala 3' %}
In Scala 3, an implicit conversion from type `S` to type `T` is defined by a [given instance]({% link _tour/implicit-parameters.md %}) which has type `scala.Conversion[S, T]`. For compatibility with Scala 2, they can also be defined by an implicit method (read more in the Scala 2 tab).
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Implicit conversions are applied in two situations:

1. If an expression `e` is of type `S`, and `S` does not conform to the expression's expected type `T`.
2. In a selection `e.m` with `e` of type `S`, if the selector `m` does not denote a member of `S`.

In the first case, a conversion `c` is searched for, which is applicable to `e` and whose result type conforms to `T`.

An example is to pass a `scala.Int`, e.g. `x`, to a method that expects `scala.Long`. In this case, the implicit conversion `Int.int2long(x)` is inserted.


In the second case, a conversion `c` is searched for, which is applicable to `e` and whose result contains a member named `m`.

An example is to compare two strings `"foo" < "bar"`. In this case, `String` has no member `<`, so the implicit conversion `Predef.augmentString("foo") < "bar"` is inserted. (`scala.Predef` is automatically imported into all Scala programs.)

### How are implicit conversions brought into scope? ###

{% tabs implicit-conversion-scope class=tabs-scala-version %}
{% tab 'Scala 2' %}
In Scala 2, an implicit conversion is brought into scope by importing from the object that defined it, (e.g. `Conversions` in this case). If the implicit conversion is in the companion object of the argument type, (e.g. `Student` in this case), then no import is necessary.

```scala
import scala.language.implicitConversions // required to define an implicit conversion

case class Student(name: String)
object Student {
  implicit def fromStudentToInt(student: Student): Int = student.name.length
}
  
object Conversions {
  implicit def fromStringToStudent(name: String): Student = Student(name)
}

import Conversions._
object Usage {
  def main(args: Array[String]) = {
    val reginald: Student = "Reginald" // applies the conversion Conversions.fromStringToStudent
    println(reginald + 2)              // applies the conversion Student.fromStudentToInt
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab 'Scala 3' %}
In Scala 3, an implicit conversion is brought into scope by either importing `given` or the named conversion from the object that defined it, (e.g. `Conversions` in this case). 

Note that as of Scala 3, implicit conversions cannot be brought into scope anymore by means of a wildcard import (`*`). 

Given the example:

```scala
case class Student(name: String):
  def printName: Unit = println(name)
object Student:
  given Conversion[Student, Int] = _.name.length
  
object Conversions:
  given fromStringToStudent: Conversion[String, Student] = Student(_)
```

The following imports would bring the `Conversion[String, Student]` into scope:
  - `import Conversions.given`
  - `import Conversions.{given Conversion[String, Student]}`
  - `import Conversions.fromStringToStudent`

If the implicit conversion is in the companion object of the argument type, (e.g. `Student` in this case), then no import is necessary.

```scala
import Conversions.given
object Usage:
  @main def run =
    val reginald: Student = "Reginald" // applies the Conversion[String, Student]
    println(reginald + 2)              // applies the Conversion[Student, Int]
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Beware the power of implicit conversions

{% tabs implicit-conversion-warning class=tabs-scala-version %}
{% tab 'Scala 2' %}
Because implicit conversions can have pitfalls if used indiscriminately the compiler warns when compiling the implicit conversion definition.

To turn off the warnings take either of these actions:

* Import `scala.language.implicitConversions` into the scope of the implicit conversion definition
* Invoke the compiler with `-language:implicitConversions`

No warning is emitted when the conversion is applied by the compiler.
{% endtab %}
{% tab 'Scala 3' %}
Because implicit conversions can have pitfalls if used indiscriminately the compiler warns in two situations:
- when compiling a Scala 2 style implicit conversion definition.
- at the call site where a given instance of `scala.Conversion` is inserted as a conversion.

To turn off the warnings take either of these actions:

- Import `scala.language.implicitConversions` into the scope of:
  - a Scala 2 style implicit conversion definition
  - call sites where a given instance of `scala.Conversion` is inserted as a conversion.
- Invoke the compiler with `-language:implicitConversions`
