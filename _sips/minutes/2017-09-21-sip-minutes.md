## Proceedings
### Opening Remarks


**Darja** introduces herself as a Scala Center's Communication Manager to the Committee and the Community.

### [SIP-NN: Right-Associative By-Name Operators](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/right-associative-by-name-operators.html) (Numbered: SIP-34)
[YouTube time: 2'50''- 8'26''](https://youtu.be/yzTpVbTUj18?t=169)

**Jorge** opens the meeting and gives the word to **Adriaan**, the the reviewer.
**Adriaan** introduces the SIP and describes why it's important. In essence, the proposal aims at removing the eager evaluation of right-associative operators. This change is important for the new collection redesign supposed to happen in 2.13.

Notes that the SIP is a nice cleanup, that there is a spec change in the SIP, suggests talking about "tweaking a wording" but that overall the SIP should be accepted.
Eugene, Martin and Seb all agree that this is a pretty uncontroversial change
**Everyone** agrees.
**Jorge** points out the protocol, stating that for this meeting the voting is about numbering the proposal and that the voting for accepting should be to be in a month, for the next meeting.
After a short discussion about the protocol, mainly about skipping the numbering step and immediately accepting the SIP, everyone agrees to proceed with the standard steps, and let the following month for the community comments.

**Conclusion**: The SIP is numbered as "SIP-34", by unanimity and it will be at disposal for a month for the community comments.

### [SIP-ZZ: Opaque types](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/opaque-types.html) (Numbered: SIP-35)
[YouTube time: 8'27''-51'13''](https://youtu.be/yzTpVbTUj18?t=507)

**Sébastien**, as a reviewer, is asked to present the SIP to the Committee and Public.
The Committee likes the proposal overall, though it has some questions/concerns.
In a 40min discussion the questions raised were as follows:

1. Articulating the motivation, emphasis on what is the concrete use of it
2. Articulating the direction regarding the value classes
3. How do we explain to users having both opaque types and multi parameter value classes **Eugene** [(link 1)](https://youtu.be/yzTpVbTUj18?t=1005); [(link 2)](https://youtu.be/yzTpVbTUj18?t=1094)
- Even "getting rid" of value classes, and letting opaque taking its place? **Seth** [(link)](https://youtu.be/yzTpVbTUj18?t=1753)
4. The importance of consistency across the language **Josh** [(link)](https://youtu.be/yzTpVbTUj18?t=1442)
5. Mention impact on Valhalla, value types at the JVM level
6. Investigate the possibilities for exposing bounds **Martin** [(link)](https://youtu.be/yzTpVbTUj18?t=2092)
7. Opaque type companion **Iulian** [(link)](https://youtu.be/yzTpVbTUj18?t=788)
- Raising confusion about the companion relation **Heather** and **Seth** [(link)](https://youtu.be/yzTpVbTUj18?t=1545)
Syntax "new" "type"


**Conclusion**: The SIP is numbered as "SIP 35" by unanimous vote. The above mentioned should to be addressed for the next meeting.


### [SIP-33: Match infix and prefix types to meet expression rules](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/make-types-behave-like-expressions.html)

Still waiting on the implementation updates, therefore this item will be discussed in the next SIP Meeting.

### [SIP-28 and SIP-29: Inline and meta](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/inline-meta.html)
[YouTube time: 51'40'' until the end](https://youtu.be/yzTpVbTUj18?t=3100)

**Eugene** gives a brief history of this SIP development, shares the good news and suggests how to proceed.

**Eugene** is proud to report that the new prototype "looks good" and was published at Scala Days 2017. It can handle the def macros, macro notations and other.
Furthermore, there is a possibility of scaling it up to potentially replace the Scala reflect macros.
He raises the concern about moving forward.
He points out that so far the proposal was done on the voluntary basis and therefore the progress was slowed down.
However, after the Advisory Board approved to involve Scala Center to assist the community with "productionizing the existing prototype", there is a bright future for the project.

That said, **Eugene** suggests to delay the proposal in order to allow the time to see what comes out of the experiments.
After **Heather** raises the question about project transfer, proposing **Olaf** as a new lead and **Eugene** as an advisor, **Eugene** agrees and is happy that the project can move forward.

**Conclusion**: The SIP is delayed until **Olaf** gathers the team and has some new updates to share with the Committee.
