## Motivation ##

We would like to allow parameters to traits. These replace early definitions, which are complicated and hard to get right.

## Syntax ##

The syntax already allows this. Excerpting from Dotty's SyntaxSummary.txt (the one for Scala 2 is analogous):

    TmplDef ::=  ([`case'] `class' | `trait') ClassDef
    ClassDef ::=  id [ClsTypeParamClause] [ConstrMods] ClsParamClauses TemplateOpt
    TemplateOpt ::=  [`extends' Template | [nl] TemplateBody]
    Template ::=  ConstrApps [TemplateBody] | TemplateBody
    ConstrApps ::=  ConstrApp {`with' ConstrApp}
    ConstrApp  ::=  AnnotType {ArgumentExprs}

In the `ClassDef` of traits, we still do not allow secondary constructors.

## Initialization Order ##

Parent traits can now be introduced as a type or as a constructor which can take arguments. The order of initialization of traits is unaffected by parameter passing - as always, traits are initialized in linearization order.

## Restrictions ##

The following rules ensure that every parameterized trait is passed an argument list exactly when it is initialized:

1. Only classes can pass arguments to parent traits. Traits themselves can pass arguments to neither classes nor traits.

2. If a class `C` implements a parameterized trait `T`, and its superclass does not, then `T` must appear as a parent trait of `C` with arguments. By contrast, if the superclass of `C` also implements `T`, then `C` may not pass arguments to `T`.

For example, assume the declarations

    trait T(x: A)
    trait U extends T

`U` may not pass arguments to `T`. On the other hand, a class implementing `U` must ensure that `T` obtains arguments for its parameters. So the following would be illegal:

    class C extends U

We have to add the trait `T` as a direct parent of `C`. This can be done in one of two ways:

    class C extends T(e) with U
    class C extends U with T(e)

Both class definitions have the same linearization. `T` is in each case initialized before `U` since `T` is inherited by `U`.

The arguments to a trait are in each case evaluated immediately before the trait initializer is run (except for call-by-name arguments, which are always evaluated on demand).

This means that in the example above the expression `e` is evaluated before the initializer of either `T` or `U` is run. On the other hand, assuming the declarations

    trait V(x2: B)
    class D extends T(e1) with V(e2)

the evaluation order would be `e1`, initializer of `T`, `e2`, initializer of `V`.
