Your feedback is welcome! If you're interested in discussing this proposal, head over to [this](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/sip-nn-make-infix-type-alias-precedence-like-expression-operator-precedence/471) Scala Contributors thread and let me know what you think.

## Introduction
Currently scala supports unary prefix operators (`-`, `+`, `~`, `!`) for expressions (e.g., `def unary_-`) and does not support prefix types.  See the Scala specification [Prefix Operations](http://scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.12/06-expressions.html#prefix-operations) section.

**Prefix expression vs. prefix type example**:

```scala
object PrefixExpression {
  case class Nummy(expand : String) {
    def unary_- : Nummy = Nummy(s"-$this")
    def unary_~ : Nummy = Nummy(s"~$this")
    def unary_! : Nummy = Nummy(s"!$this")
    def unary_+ : Nummy = Nummy(s"+$this")
  }
  object N extends Nummy("N")
  val n1 = -N
  val n2 = ~N
  val n3 = !N
  val n4 = +N
}
object NonExistingPrefixTypes {
  trait unary_-[A]
  trait unary_~[A]
  trait unary_![A]
  trait unary_+[A]
  trait N
  type N1 = -N //Not working
  type N2 = ~N //Not working
  type N3 = !N //Not working
  type N4 = +N //Not working
}
```

## Motivation
It is easier to reason about the language when mathematical and logical operations for both terms and types are expressed the same. The proposal is relevant solely for projects which utilize numeric literal type operations (supported by SIP23, which was not yet accepted into Lightbend Scala). However, the SIP's implementation is very small and should have minor effect on compiler performance. 

### Motivating examples

#### Singleton-ops library example

The [singleton-ops library](https://github.com/fthomas/singleton-ops) with [Typelevel Scala](https://github.com/typelevel/scala) (which implemented [SIP-23](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/42.type.html)) enable developers to express literal type operations more intuitively. 

Consider the following example, where `foo` has two equivalent implementations, one using types, while the other uses terms:

```scala
import singleton.ops._

object PrefixExample {
  /*
  We would much rather write the following to acheive more clarity and shorter code:
  type Foo[Cond1, Cond2, Num] = ITE[Cond1 && !Cond2, -Num, Num]	
  */
  type Foo[Cond1, Cond2, Num] = ITE[Cond1 && ![Cond2], Negate[Num], Num]
  //foo executes typelevel operations by using singleton-ops
  def foo[Cond1, Cond2, Num](implicit f : Foo[Cond1, Cond2, Num]) : f.Out = f.value
  //foo executes term operations
  def foo(cond1 : Boolean, cond2 : Boolean, num : Int) : Int = 
    if (cond1 && !cond2) -num else num
}

import PrefixExample._

foo[true, false, 3] //returns -3
foo(true, false, 3) //returns -3
```

Note: `type ![A]` is possible to define, but `type -[A]` is not due to collision with infix type parsing.

#### DFiant library example

DFiant is a domain specific language for hardware description I (Oron) am developing. Hardware interfaces have a direction annotation (e.g., `vec : DFBits[8] <> IN`). Sometime interfaces have multiple ports, in different directions. E.g.:

```scala
trait MyInterface {
  val data : DFBits[32] <> IN
  val address : DFBits[32] <> OUT
}
```

To be able to use the same interface in reverse, we need the ability to easily express it as:

```scala
trait MyReversableInterface[D <: Direction] {
  val data : DFBits[32] <> D
  val address : DFBits[32] <> ~D
}
```

An implicit conversion can then assure that `~IN` is translated to `OUT` and vice-versa.

Interfaces may possess dozens of ports, thus without prefix types can be quite cumbersome.

## Proposal

Add support for prefix types, which is equivalent to the prefix operations for expressions.

```
PrefixType ::= [`-' | `+' | `~' | `!'] SimpleType
CompoundType ::= PrefixType
              |  AnnotType {with AnnotType} [Refinement]
              |  Refinement
```

### Interactions with other language features

#### Variance Annotation
Variance annotation uses the `-` and `+` symbols to annotate contravariant and covariant subtyping, respectively. Introducing unary prefix types may lead to some developer confusion. However, such interaction is very unlikely to occur. E.g.:

```scala
trait Negate[A]
trait Positive[A]
type unary_-[A] = Negate[A]
type unary_+[A] = Positive[A]
trait Contravariant[B, -A <: +B] //contravariant A subtype upper-bounded by Positive[B]
trait Covariant[B, +A <: -B] //covariant A subtype upper-bounded by Negative[B]
```

#### Negative Literal Types
Negative literal types are annotated using the `-` symbol. This can lead to the following confusion:

```scala
trait Negate[A]
type unary_-[A] = Negate[A]
trait MyTrait[B]

type MinusFortyTwo = MyTrait[-42]
type NegateFortyTwo = MyTrait[Negate[42]]
```

The above example demonstrates a case of two types `MinusFortyTwo` and `NegateFortyTwo` which are different. They may be equivalent in view (implicit conversion between the two type instances), but they are not equal.

Note: It is not possible to annotate a positive literal type in Scala (checked both in TLS and Dotty):

```scala
val a : 42 = +42 //works
val b : -42 = -42 //works
val c : +42 = 42 //error: ';' expected but integer literal found
```

This means that if unary prefix types are added, then `+42` will be a type expansion of `unary_+[42]`.

* [Typelevel Scala Issue #157](https://github.com/typelevel/scala/issues/157) (Resolved in recent update to SIP23)

Dotty's implementation of literal types currently fail compilation when infix types interact with a negative literal type.
```scala
type ~~[A, B]
type good = 2 ~~ 2
type bad = 2 ~~ -2 //Error:(9, 20) ';' expected but integer literal found.
type work_around = 2 ~~ (-2) //Error in Dotty
```
