## Summary

The purpose of binary APIs is to have publicly accessible definitions in generated bytecode for definitions that are package private or protected.
This proposal introduces the `@publicInBinary` annotation on term definitions and the `-WunstableInlineAccessors` linting flag.


## Motivation

### Provide a sound way to refer to private members in inline definitions

Currently, the compiler automatically generates accessors for references to private members in inline definitions. This scheme interacts poorly with binary compatibility. It causes the following three unsoundness in the system:
* Changing any definition from private to public is a binary incompatible change
* Changing the implementation of an inline definition can be a binary incompatible change
* Removing final from a class is a binary incompatible change

You can find more details in [https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/16983](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/16983)

### Avoid duplication of inline accessors

Ideally, private definitions should have a maximum of one inline accessor, which is not the case now.
When an inline method accesses a private/protected definition that is defined outside of its class, we generate an inline in the class of the inline method. This implies that accessors might be duplicated if a private/protected definition is accessed from different classes.

### Removing deprecated APIs

There is no precise mechanism to remove a deprecated method from a library without causing binary incompatibilities. We should have a straightforward way to indicate that a method is no longer publicly available but still available in the generated code for binary compatibility.

```diff
- @deprecated(...) def myOldAPI: T = ...
+ private[C] def myOldAPI: T = ...
```

Related to discussion in [https://github.com/lightbend/mima/discussions/724](https://github.com/lightbend/mima/discussions/724).

### No way to inline reference to private constructors

It is currently impossible to refer to private constructors in inline methods.
```scala
class C private()
object C:
  inline def newC: C = new C() // Implementation restriction: cannot use private constructors in inline methods
```
If users want to access one of those, they must write an accessor explicitly. This extra indirection is undesirable.
```scala
class C private()
object C:
  private def newCInternal: C = new C()
  inline def newC: C = newCInternal
```

## Proposed solution

### High-level overview

This proposal introduces the `@publicInBinary` annotation, and adds a migration path to inline methods in libraries (requiring binary compatibility).

#### `@publicInBinary` annotation

A binary API is a definition that is annotated with `@publicInBinary`.
This annotation can be placed on `def`, `val`, `lazy val`, `var`, `object`, and `given` definitions.
A binary API will be publicly available in the bytecode.

This annotation cannot be used on `private`/`private[this]` definitions. With the exception of class constructors.

Removing this annotation from a non-public definition is a binary incompatible change.

Example:

~~~ scala
class C {
  @publicInBinary private[C] def packagePrivateAPI: Int = ...
  @publicInBinary protected def protectedAPI: Int = ...
  @publicInBinary def publicAPI: Int = ... // warn: `@publicInBinary` has no effect on public definitions
}
~~~
will generate the following bytecode signatures
~~~ java
public class C {
  public C();
  public int packagePrivateAPI();
  public int protectedAPI();
  public int publicAPI();
}
~~~

In the bytecode, `@publicInBinary` definitions will have the [ACC_PUBLIC](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1-200-E.1) flag.
<!-- We can also set the [ACC_SYNTHETIC](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1-200-E.1) to hide these definitions from javac and java IDEs. -->

#### Binary API and inlining

A non-public reference in an inline method is handled as follows:
 - if the reference is a `@publicInBinary` the reference is used;
 - otherwise, an accessor is automatically generated and used.

Example:
~~~ scala
import scala.annotation.publicInBinary
class C {
  @publicInBinary private[C] def a: Int = ...
  private[C] def b: Int = ...
  @publicInBinary protected def c: Int = ...
  protected def d: Int = ...
  inline def foo: Int = a + b + c + d
}
~~~
before inlining the compiler will generate the accessors for inlined definitions
~~~ scala
class C {
  @publicInBinary private[C] def a: Int = ...
  private[C] def b: Int = ...
  @publicInBinary protected def c: Int = ...
  protected def d: Int = ...
  final def C$$inline$b: Int = ...
  final def C$$inline$d: Int = ...
  inline def foo: Int = a + C$$inline$b + c + C$$inline$d
}
~~~

##### `-WunstableInlineAccessors`

In addition we introduce the `-WunstableInlineAccessors` flag to allow libraries to detect when the compiler generates unstable accessors.
The previous code would show a linter warning that looks like this:

~~~
-- [E...] Compatibility Warning: C.scala -----------------------------
  |  inline def foo: Int = a + b + c + d
  |                            ^
  |            Unstable inline accessor C$$inline$b was generated in class C.
  |
  | longer explanation available when compiling with `-explain`
-- [E...] Compatibility Warning: C.scala -----------------------------
  |  inline def foo: Int = a + b + c + d
  |                                    ^
  |            Unstable inline accessor C$$inline$d was generated in class C.
  |
  | longer explanation available when compiling with `-explain`
~~~

When an accessor is detected we can tell the user how to fix the issue. For example we could use the `-explain` flag to add the following details to the message.

<details>
<summary>With `-WunstableInlineAccessors -explain`</summary>

-- [E...] Compatibility Warning: C.scala -----------------------------

  |                            ^
  |            Unstable inline accessor C$$inline$b was generated in class C.
  |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | Explanation (enabled by `-explain`)
  |- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  | Access to non-public method b causes the automatic generation of an accessor.
  | This accessor is not stable, its name may change or it may disappear

  |
  | To make sure that the inlined code is binary compatible you must make sure that
  | method b is public in the binary API.
  |  * Option 1: Annotate method b with @publicInBinary
  |  * Option 2: Make method b public
  |
  | This change may break binary compatibility if a previous version of this
  | library was compiled with generated accessors. Binary compatibility should
  | be checked using MiMa. If binary compatibility is broken, you should add the
  | old accessor explicitly in the source code. The following code should be
  | added to class C:
  |   @publicInBinary private[C] def C$$inline$b: Int = this.b
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Specification

We must add `publicInBinary` to the standard library.

```scala
package scala.annotation

final class publicInBinary extends scala.annotation.StaticAnnotation
```

#### `@publicInBinary` annotation

* Only valid on `def`, `val`, `lazy val`, `var`, `object`, and `given`.
* If a definition overrides a `@publicInBinary` definition, it must also be annotated with `@publicInBinary`.
* TASTy will contain references to non-public definitions that are out of scope but `@publicInBinary`. TASTy already allows those references.
* The annotated definitions will be public in the generated bytecode. Definitions should be made public as early as possible in the compiler phases, as this can remove the need to create other accessors. It should be done after we check the accessibility of references.

#### Inline

* Inlining will not require the generation of an inline accessor for binary APIs.
* The user will be warned if a new inline accessor is automatically generated under `-WunstableInlineAccessors`.
  The message will suggest `@publicInBinary` and how to fix potential incompatibilities.

### Compatibility

The introduction of the `@publicInBinary` do not introduce any binary incompatibility.

Using references to `@publicInBinary` in inline code can cause binary incompatibilities. These incompatibilities are equivalent to the ones that can occur due to the unsoundness we want to fix. When migrating to binary APIs, the compiler will show the implementation of accessors that the users need to add to keep binary compatibility with pre-publicInBinary code.

### Other concerns

* Tools that analyze inlined TASTy code will need to know about `@publicInBinary`. For example [MiMa](https://github.com/lightbend/mima/) and [TASTy MiMa](https://github.com/scalacenter/tasty-mima).

## Alternatives

### Add a `@binaryAccessor`
This annotation would generate an stable accessor. This annotation could be used on `private` definition. It would also mitigate [migration costs](https://gist.github.com/nicolasstucki/003f7293941836b08a0d53dbcb913e3c) for library authors that have published unstable accessors.

* Implementation https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/16992


### Make all `private[C]` part of the binary API

Currently, we already make `private[C]` public in the binary API but do not have the same guarantees regarding binary compatibility.
For example, the following change is binary compatible but would remove the existence of the `private[C]` definition in the bytecode.
```diff
class C:
-  private[C] def f: T = ...
```
We could change the rules to make all `private[C]` part of binary compatible to flag such a change as binary incompatible. This would imply that all these
methods can be accessed directly from inline methods without generating an accessor.

The drawback of this approach is that that we would need to force users to keep their `private[C]` methods even if they never used inline methods.

  is stricter as they do not support automatic accessor generation.
