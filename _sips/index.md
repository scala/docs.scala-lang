Two separate processes govern changes to Scala:

1. The **Scala Improvement Process** (SIP) covers changes to the Scala
language, the Scala compiler, and the core of the Scala standard
library.

2. The **Scala Platform Process** (SPP) aims to establish a stable
collection of libraries suitable for widespread use, with a low barrier
to entry for newcomers.

## Scala Improvement Process (SIP)

The **SIP** (_Scala Improvement Process_) is a process for submitting
changes to the Scala language. This process aims to evolve Scala
openly and collaboratively.

The SIP process covers the Scala language and compiler and the core of
the Scala standard library.  (The core is anything that is unlikely to
be spun off into a separate module.)

A proposed change requires a design document, called a Scala
Improvement Proposal (SIP).  The SIP committee meets monthly to
discuss, and eventually vote upon, proposals.

A SIP is subject to a [review process](./sip-submission.html).
Proposals normally include proposed changes to the
[Scala language specification](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.12/).
Before reaching the committee, a proposal normally receives community
discussion and review on the
[Scala Contributors](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/) forum.
Please read [Submitting a SIP](./sip-submission.html) and our
[SIP tutorial](./sip-tutorial.html) for more information.

> Historical note: The SIP replaces the older SID (Scala Improvement Document) process.
> Completed SID documents remain available in the
> [completed section of the SIP list](all.html).

## Scala Platform Process (SPP)

The Scala Platform aims to be a stable collection of libraries with widespread
use and a low barrier to entry for beginners and intermediate users. The
Platform consists of several independent modules that solve specific problems.
The Scala community sets the overall direction of the Platform.
