## Quick Online Exercises
[Scala Exercises](https://www.scala-exercises.org/) is a series of lessons and exercises created by [47 Degrees](https://www.47deg.com/). It's a great way to get a brief introduction to Scala while testing your knowledge along the way.

## Online Courses from EPFL

The following courses are available for free. They teach you the main features of the Scala language and introduce you
to functional programming. They are published either on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) or [edX](https://www.edx.org).

 * [Functional Programming in Scala Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala).
   The Specialization provides a hands-on introduction to functional programming using Scala. You can access the courses
   material and exercises by either signing up for the specialization or auditing the courses individually. The
   specialization has the following courses.
    * [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1),
    * [Functional Program Design in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun2),
    * [Parallel programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/parprog1),
    * [Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-spark-big-data),
    * [Functional Programming in Scala Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-capstone),
 * [Programming Reactive Systems](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-reactive) (also available on [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/programming-reactive-systems)).

Note : On Coursera and edX, there is a paid version available. The only difference with the free version is that
the paid version delivers a certificate of completion. Learn more about
