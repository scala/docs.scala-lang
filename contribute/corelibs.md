## Core Library Contributions

There are several options for contributing to Scala's core libraries. You can:

* Help with [Documentation](/contribute/scala-standard-library-api-documentation/).
* [Report Bugs or Issues](/contribute/bug-reporting-guide.html) against the core libraries.
* [Fix Bugs or Issues](/contribute/guide/) against the
  [reported library bugs/issues](https://issues.scala-lang.org/issues/?filter=13001).
* Contribute significant new functionality or a new API by submitting
  a Scala Library Improvement Process (SLIP) Document.

### Submitting a SLIP

For significant new functionality or a whole new API to be considered for
inclusion in the core Scala distribution, you will be asked to submit a SLIP (Scala Library Improvement Process) document.

Please see [instructions for submitting a new SLIP](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/slip-submission.html) and familiarize yourself with the [SIP/SLIP](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/) section of the Scala documentation site. Also please pay particular attention to the [pre-requisites](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/slip-submission.html) before submitting a SLIP.
