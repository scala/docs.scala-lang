The Scala programming language is an open source project with a very
diverse community, where people from all over the world contribute their work,
with everyone benefiting from friendly help and advice, and
kindly helping others in return. So why not join the Scala community and help
everyone make things better?

## How to help?

That depends on what you want to contribute. Below are some getting started resources for different contribution domains.

### Tools and Libraries

The Scala ecosystem includes a great many diverse open-source projects
with their own maintainers and community of contributors.  Helping out
one of these projects is another way to help Scala.  Consider lending
on a hand on a project you're already using.  Or, to find out about
other projects, see the
[Libraries and Tools section](../community/index.html#community-libraries-and-tools)
on our Community page.

### Scala Community Build

The Scala community build enables the Scala compiler team
to build and test a corpus of
Scala open source projects
against development versions of the Scala compiler and standard
library in order to discover regressions prior to releases.
The build uses Typesafe's
[dbuild](https://github.com/typesafehub/dbuild) tool,
which leverages [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org).

If you're the maintainer -- or just an interested user! -- of an
open-source Scala library or tool, please visit the
[community build documentation](https://github.com/scala/community-builds/wiki)
for guidelines on what projects are suitable for the community build
and how projects can be added.
