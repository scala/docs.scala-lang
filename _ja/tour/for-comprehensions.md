Scala offers a lightweight notation for expressing *sequence comprehensions*. Comprehensions have the form `for (enumerators) yield e`, where `enumerators` refers to a semicolon-separated list of enumerators. An *enumerator* is either a generator which introduces new variables, or it is a filter. A comprehension evaluates the body `e` for each binding generated by the enumerators and returns a sequence of these values.

Here's an example:

```tut
case class User(name: String, age: Int)

val userBase = List(User("Travis", 28),
  User("Kelly", 33),
  User("Jennifer", 44),
  User("Dennis", 23))

val twentySomethings = for (user <- userBase if (user.age >=20 && user.age < 30))
  yield user.name  // i.e. add this to a list

twentySomethings.foreach(name => println(name))  // prints Travis Dennis
```
The `for` loop used with a `yield` statement actually creates a `List`. Because we said `yield user.name`, it's a `List[String]`. `user <- userBase` is our generator and `if (user.age >=20 && user.age < 30)` is a guard that filters out users who are not in their 20s.

Here is a more complicated example using two generators. It computes all pairs of numbers between `0` and `n-1` whose sum is equal to a given value `v`:

```tut
def foo(n: Int, v: Int) =
   for (i <- 0 until n;
        j <- 0 until n if i + j == v)
   yield (i, j)

foo(10, 10) foreach {
  case (i, j) =>
    println(s"($i, $j) ")  // prints (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 5) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 1)
}

```
Here `n == 10` and `v == 10`. On the first iteration, `i == 0` and `j == 0` so `i + j != v` and therefore nothing is yielded. `j` gets incremented 9 more times before `i` gets incremented to `1`. Without the `if` guard, this would simply print the following:
```

(0, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) ...
```

Note that comprehensions are not restricted to lists. Every datatype that supports the operations `withFilter`, `map`, and `flatMap` (with the proper types) can be used in sequence comprehensions.

You can omit `yield` in a comprehension. In that case, comprehension will return `Unit`. This can be useful in case you need to perform side-effects. Here's a program equivalent to the previous one, but without using `yield`:

```tut
def foo(n: Int, v: Int) =
   for (i <- 0 until n;
        j <- 0 until n if i + j == v)
   println(s"($i, $j)")

foo(10, 10)
```
