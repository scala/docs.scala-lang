Annotations associate meta-information with definitions. For example, the annotation `@deprecated` before a method causes the compiler to print a warning if the method is used.
```
object DeprecationDemo extends App {
  @deprecated("deprecation message", "release # which deprecates method")
  def hello = "hola"

  hello  
}
```
This will compile but the compiler will print a warning: "there was one deprecation warning".

An annotation clause applies to the first definition or declaration following it. More than one annotation clause may precede a definition and declaration. The order in which these clauses are given does not matter.


## Annotations that ensure correctness of encodings
Certain annotations will actually cause compilation to fail if a condition(s) is not met. For example, the annotation `@tailrec` ensures that a method is [tail-recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call). Tail-recursion can keep memory requirements constant. Here's how it's used in a method which calculates the factorial:
```tut
import scala.annotation.tailrec

def factorial(x: Int): Int = {

  @tailrec
  def factorialHelper(x: Int, accumulator: Int): Int = {
    if (x == 1) accumulator else factorialHelper(x - 1, accumulator * x)
  }
  factorialHelper(x, 1)
}
```
The `factorialHelper` method has the `@tailrec` which ensures the method is indeed tail-recursive. If we were to change the implementation of `factorialHelper` to the following, it would fail:
```
import scala.annotation.tailrec

def factorial(x: Int): Int = {
  @tailrec
  def factorialHelper(x: Int): Int = {
    if (x == 1) 1 else x * factorialHelper(x - 1)
  }
  factorialHelper(x)
}
```
We would get the message "Recursive call not in tail position".


## Annotations affecting code generation
Some annotations like `@inline` affect the generated code (i.e. your jar file might have different bytes than if you hadn't used the annotation). Inlining means inserting the code in a method's body at the call site. The resulting bytecode is longer, but hopefully runs faster. Using the annotation `@inline` does not ensure that a method will be inlined, but it will cause the compiler to do it if and only if some heuristics about the size of the generated code are met.

### Java Annotations ###
When writing Scala code which interoperates with Java, there are a few differences in annotation syntax to note.
**Note:** Make sure you use the `-target:jvm-1.8` option with Java annotations.

Java has user-defined metadata in the form of [annotations](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/). A key feature of annotations is that they rely on specifying name-value pairs to initialize their elements. For instance, if we need an annotation to track the source of some class we might define it as

```
@interface Source {
  public String URL();
  public String mail();
}
```

And then apply it as follows

```
@Source(URL = "http://coders.com/",
        mail = "support@coders.com")
public class MyClass extends TheirClass ...
```

An annotation application in Scala looks like a constructor invocation, for instantiating a Java annotation one has to use named arguments:

```
@Source(URL = "http://coders.com/",
        mail = "support@coders.com")
class MyScalaClass ...
```

This syntax is quite tedious if the annotation contains only one element (without default value) so, by convention, if the name is specified as `value` it can be applied in Java using a constructor-like syntax:

```
@interface SourceURL {
    public String value();
    public String mail() default "";
}
```

And then apply it as follows

```
@SourceURL("http://coders.com/")
public class MyClass extends TheirClass ...
```

In this case, Scala provides the same possibility

```
@SourceURL("http://coders.com/")
class MyScalaClass ...
```

The `mail` element was specified with a default value so we need not explicitly provide a value for it. However, if we need to do it we can not mix-and-match the two styles in Java:

```
@SourceURL(value = "http://coders.com/",
           mail = "support@coders.com")
public class MyClass extends TheirClass ...
```

Scala provides more flexibility in this respect

```
@SourceURL("http://coders.com/",
           mail = "support@coders.com")
    class MyScalaClass ...
```
