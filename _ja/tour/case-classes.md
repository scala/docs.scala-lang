Case classes are like regular classes with a few key differences which we will go over. Case classes are good for modeling immutable data. In the next step of the tour, we'll see how they are useful in [pattern matching](pattern-matching.html).

## Defining a case class
A minimal case class requires the keywords `case class`, an identifier, and a parameter list (which may be empty):
```tut
case class Book(isbn: String)

val frankenstein = Book("978-0486282114")
```
Notice how the keyword `new` was not used to instantiate the `Book` case class. This is because case classes have an `apply` method by default which takes care of object construction.

When you create a case class with parameters, the parameters are public `val`s.
```
case class Message(sender: String, recipient: String, body: String)
val message1 = Message("guillaume@quebec.ca", "jorge@catalonia.es", "Ã‡a va ?")

println(message1.sender)  // prints guillaume@quebec.ca
message1.sender = "travis@washington.us"  // this line does not compile
```
You can't reassign `message1.sender` because it is a `val` (i.e. immutable). It is possible to use `var`s in case classes but this is discouraged.

## Comparison
Case classes are compared by structure and not by reference:
```
case class Message(sender: String, recipient: String, body: String)

val message2 = Message("jorge@catalonia.es", "guillaume@quebec.ca", "Com va?")
val message3 = Message("jorge@catalonia.es", "guillaume@quebec.ca", "Com va?")
val messagesAreTheSame = message2 == message3  // true
```
Even though `message2` and `message3` refer to different objects, the value of each object is equal.

## Copying
You can create a (shallow) copy of an instance of a case class simply by using the `copy` method. You can optionally change the constructor arguments.
```
case class Message(sender: String, recipient: String, body: String)
val message4 = Message("julien@bretagne.fr", "travis@washington.us", "Me zo o komz gant ma amezeg")
val message5 = message4.copy(sender = message4.recipient, recipient = "claire@bourgogne.fr")
message5.sender  // travis@washington.us
message5.recipient // claire@bourgogne.fr
message5.body  // "Me zo o komz gant ma amezeg"
```
The recipient of `message4` is used as the sender of `message5` but the `body` of `message4` was copied directly.
