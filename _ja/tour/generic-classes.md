Generic classes are classes which take a type as a parameter. They are particularly useful for collection classes.

## Defining a generic class
Generic classes take a type as a parameter within square brackets `[]`. One convention is to use the letter `A` as type parameter identifier, though any parameter name may be used.
```tut
class Stack[A] {
  private var elements: List[A] = Nil
  def push(x: A) { elements = x :: elements }
  def peek: A = elements.head
  def pop(): A = {
    val currentTop = peek
    elements = elements.tail
    currentTop
  }
}
```
This implementation of a `Stack` class takes any type `A` as a parameter. This means the underlying list, `var elements: List[A] = Nil`, can only store elements of type `A`. The procedure `def push` only accepts objects of type `A` (note: `elements = x :: elements` reassigns `elements` to a new list created by prepending `x` to the current `elements`).

## Usage

To use a generic class, put the type in the square brackets in place of `A`.
```
val stack = new Stack[Int]
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
println(stack.pop)  // prints 2
println(stack.pop)  // prints 1
```
The instance `stack` can only take Ints. However, if the type argument had subtypes, those could be passed in:
```
class Fruit
class Apple extends Fruit
class Banana extends Fruit

val stack = new Stack[Fruit]
val apple = new Apple
val banana = new Banana

stack.push(apple)
stack.push(banana)
```
Class `Apple` and `Banana` both extend `Fruit` so we can push instances `apple` and `banana` onto the stack of `Fruit`.

_Note: subtyping of generic types is *invariant*. This means that if we have a stack of characters of type `Stack[Char]` then it cannot be used as an integer stack of type `Stack[Int]`. This would be unsound because it would enable us to enter true integers into the character stack. To conclude, `Stack[A]` is only a subtype of `Stack[B]` if and only if `B = A`. Since this can be quite restrictive, Scala offers a [type parameter annotation mechanism](variances.html) to control the subtyping behavior of generic types._
