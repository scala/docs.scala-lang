Generally speaking, Scala seeks to mimic Java conventions to ease
interoperability. When in doubt regarding the idiomatic way to express a
particular concept, adopt conventions and idioms from the following
languages (in this order):

-   Java
-   [Standard ML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML)
-   Haskell
-   C\#
-   OCaml
-   Ruby
-   Python

For example, you should use Java's naming conventions for classes and
methods, but SML's conventions for type annotation, Haskell's
conventions for type parameter naming (except upper-case rather than
lower) and Ruby's conventions for non-boolean accessor methods. Scala
really is a hybrid language!
