The [Scala Center] produces online courses (a.k.a. MOOCs) of various levels, from beginner 
to advanced.

**If you are a programmer and want to learn Scala**, there are two recommended 
approaches. The fast path consists of taking the course [Effective Programming 
in Scala](#effective-programming-in-scala).
Otherwise, you can take the full [Scala Specialization], which is made of
four courses (covering advanced topics such as big data analysis and 
parallel programming) and a capstone project.

You can learn more about the courses in the following video:

## Scala Learning Path

The diagram below summarizes the possible learning paths with our courses:

![](/resources/images/learning-path.png)

The “foundational” courses target programmers with no prior experience in Scala, whereas the “deepening”
courses aim at strengthening Scala programmers skills in a specific domain (such as parallel programming).

We recommend starting with either Effective Programming in Scala, or Functional Programming Principles in
Scala followed by Functional Program Design. Then, you can complement your Scala skills by taking any
of the courses Programming Reactive Systems, Parallel Programming, or Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark.
In case you take the Scala Specialization, you will end with the Scala Capstone Project.

## Learning Platforms

Currently, all our MOOCs are available on the platform [Coursera](https://coursera.org),
and some of them are available on [edX](https://edx.org) or the [Extension School](https://www.epfl.ch/education/continuing-education/).
This section explains the differences between these learning platforms.

On all the platforms the full material is always available online. It includes 
video lectures, text articles, quizzes, and auto-graded homeworks. All the 
platforms also provide discussion forums where you can exchange with the 
other learners.

The difference between the Extension School and the other platforms is that it
provides live meetings with instructors, and code reviews by Scala experts.

On the other hand, on Coursera or edX it is possible to take 
our courses for free (a.k.a. “audit” mode). Optionally, a subscription gives
you access to a certificate of completion that attests your accomplishments.

Learn more about
[Coursera certificates](https://learners.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209819053-Get-a-Course-Certificate),
[edX certificates](https://support.edx.org/hc/en-us/categories/115002269627-Certificates),
or [Extension School certificates](https://www.epfl.ch/education/continuing-education/certifications/).
Note that your subscriptions also supports the work of the [Scala Center], 
whose mission is to create high-quality educational material.

If you prefer learning in autonomy, we recommend 
you to choose the Coursera or edX platform, but if you are looking for more 
support, we recommend you to choose the Extension School. Here is a table 
below that compares the learning platforms:

|                                                  | Coursera / edX (audit) | Coursera / edX (subscription) | Extension School |

## Effective Programming in Scala

This course is available on [Coursera](https://coursera.org/learn/effective-scala)
and the [Extension School](https://www.epfl.ch/education/continuing-education/effective-programming-in-scala/).
Please refer to [this section](#learning-platforms) to know the differences 
between both learning platforms.

[Effective Programming in Scala] teaches non-Scala programmers everything
they need to be ready to work in Scala. At the end of this hands-on course,
you will know how to achieve common programming tasks in Scala (e.g.,
modeling business domains, implementing business logic, designing large
systems made of components, handling errors, manipulating data, running
concurrent tasks in parallel, testing your code). You can learn more about
this course in the following video:

</div>

This course is also a good way to upgrade your Scala 2 knowledge to Scala 3.

After taking this course, you might be interested in improving your
skills in specific areas by taking the courses [Parallel Programming],
[Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark], or [Programming Reactive Systems].

## Scala Specialization

The [Scala Specialization] provides a hands-on introduction to functional programming using Scala. You can access the courses
material and exercises by either signing up for the specialization or auditing the courses individually. The
specialization has the following courses.
* [Functional Programming Principles in Scala],
* [Functional Program Design in Scala],
* [Parallel programming],
* [Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark],
* [Functional Programming in Scala Capstone].

These courses provide a deep understanding of the Scala language itself,
and they also dive into more specific topics such as parallel programming,
and Spark.

## Programming Reactive Systems

[Programming Reactive Systems] (also available on [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/scala-akka-reactive))
teaches how to write responsive, scalable, and resilient systems with the
library Akka.

## Scala 2 Courses

The above courses all use Scala 3. If needed, you can find
the (legacy) Scala 2 version of our courses here:

- [Functional Programming Principles in Scala (Scala 2 version)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala2-functional-programming)
- [Functional Program Design (Scala 2 version)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala2-functional-program-design)
- [Parallel Programming (Scala 2 version)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala2-parallel-programming)
- [Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark (Scala 2 version)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala2-spark-big-data)
- [Programming Reactive Systems (Scala 2 version)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala2-akka-reactive)
