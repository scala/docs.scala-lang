"Functional programming (FP) is a style of software development emphasizing functions that don't depend on program state... Functional Programming in Scala is a serious tutorial for programmers looking to learn FP and apply it to the everyday business of coding. The book guides readers from basic techniques to advanced topics in a logical, concise, and clear progression. In it, you'll find concrete examples and exercises that open up the world of functional programming."

Forewords by Daniel Spiewak and Martin Odersky.
