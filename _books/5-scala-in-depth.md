"While information about the Scala language is abundant, skilled practitioners, great examples, and insight into the best practices of the community are harder to find. Scala in Depth bridges that gap, preparing you to adopt Scala successfully for real world projects. Scala in Depth is a unique new book designed to help you integrate Scala effectively into your development process. By presenting the emerging best practices and designs from the Scala community, it guides you though dozens of powerful techniques example by example. There's no heavy-handed theory here-just lots of crisp, practical guides for coding in Scala."
