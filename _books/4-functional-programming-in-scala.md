"Functional programming (FP) is a style of software development emphasizing functions that don't depend on program state... Functional Programming in Scala is a serious tutorial for programmers looking to learn FP and apply it to the everyday business of coding. The book guides readers from basic techniques to advanced topics in a logical, concise, and clear progression. In it, you'll find concrete examples and exercises that open up the world of functional programming."

Foreword by Martin Odersky.

The [Scala 3 version](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala-second-edition), co-authored by Michael Pilquist, is in early-access as of February 2022.
