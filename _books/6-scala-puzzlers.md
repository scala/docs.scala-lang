"Getting code to do what we want it to do is perhaps the essence of our purpose as developers. So there are few things more intriguing or important than code that we think we understand, but that behaves rather contrary to our expectations. Scala Puzzlers is a collection of such examples in Scala. It is not only an entertaining and instructive way of understanding this highly expressive language better. It will also help you recognize many counter-intuitive traps and pitfalls and prevent them from inflicting further production bug hunt stress on Scala developers."
