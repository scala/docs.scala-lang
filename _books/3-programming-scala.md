Both are industry experts, Alex Payne being the lead API programmer at Twitter, a social networking service based on Scala. O’Reilly, the publisher, writes: "Learn how to be more productive with Scala, a new multi-paradigm language for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that integrates features of both object-oriented and functional programming. With this book, you'll discover why Scala is ideal for highly scalable, component-based applications that support concurrency and distribution. You'll also learn how to leverage the wealth of Java class libraries to meet the practical needs of enterprise and Internet projects more easily."
